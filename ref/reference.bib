                  identified that a notable 95\% of the respondents still favor
                  live concerts over their virtual alternatives, attributing it
                  to the unparalleled value of the physical experience.
                  Furthermore, the pattern matching confirms that people's

                  nature, targeting of epitopes that are part of an
                  intrinsically disordered region of a protein is a notoriously
                  difficult task. Here, we describe a computational approach to
                  overcome this problem, based on the use of a protein-folding
                  algorithm and its confidence metrics within a Monte Carlo
                  optimization pipeline to generate peptide-based binders. For
                  different protein targets, we show by accurate free energy
                  calculations that our approach is able to design peptides with
                  binding free energies on the order of tens of k B T , i.e.,
                  with strengths comparable to covalent interactions. Direct
                  observation of the bound complex through molecular simulations
                  shows that the targeted epitope folds into structured domains
                  with lowered thermal fluctuations upon binding, while
                  remaining unstructured and dynamic in the unbound state,
                  suggesting that the protein-folding algorithm must have
                  learned the principles of induced (co-)folding. Given the
                  ubiquitous presence of unstructured regions in proteins, our
                  results suggest a potential pathway to design drugs targeting
                  a large variety of previously untargetable epitopes, and open
                  new possibilities for therapeutic intervention in diseases
                  where disordered proteins play a key role. I SIGNIFICANCE
                  Small-molecule drugs that bind to a protein via a lock-and-key
                  mechanism require the targeted epitope to form a
                  well-structured, stable binding pocket, thereby preventing
                  binding to unstructured regions. To overcome this limit, we
                  present a general approach, based on a protein-folding
                  algorithm, to find peptide sequences that induce the formation
                  of such a binding interface when no pocket is normally
                  present. In other words, we show how a protein-folding
                  algorithm can be used to program epitope recognition by
                  induced folding instead of rigid lock-and-key matching. In
                  this way, we show that we can extend druggable epitopes to
                  intrinsically disordered, dynamical regions of proteins.}

                  conformers in the native structure. Conformational entropy
                  changes can be found by comparing the number of accessible
                  rotamers in the unfolded and folded states, or by estimating
                  fusion entropies. Comparison of several sets of results using
                  different techniques shows that the mean conformational free
                  energy change (T delta S) is 1 kcal.mol-1 per side chain or
                  0.5 kcal.mol-1 per bond. Changes in vibrational entropy appear
                  to be negligible compared to the entropy change resulting from

                  are generated by V(D)J recombination and evolve according to
                  mutation and selection processes. Existing antibody language
                  models, however, focus exclusively on antibodies as strings of
                  amino acids and are fitted using standard language modeling
                  objectives such as masked or autoregressive prediction. In
                  this paper, we first show that fitting models using this
                  objective implicitly incorporates nucleotide-level mutation
                  processes as part of the protein language model, which
                  degrades performance when predicting effects of mutations on
                  functional properties of antibodies. To address this
                  limitation, we devise a new framework: a Deep Amino acid
                  Selection Model (DASM) that learns the selection effects of
                  amino-acid mutations while explicitly factoring out the
                  nucleotide-level mutation process. By fitting selection as a
                  separate term from the mutation process, the DASM exclusively
                  quantifies functional effects: effects that change some aspect
                  of the function of the antibody. This factorization leads to
                  substantially improved performance on standard functional
                  benchmarks. Moreover, our model is an order of magnitude
                  smaller and multiple orders of magnitude faster to evaluate
                  than existing approaches, as well as being readily
                  interpretable.}

  abstract     = {Abstract Most natural proteins alternate between distinct
                  conformational states, each associated with specific
                  functions. Intentional manipulation of conformational
                  equilibria could lead to improved or altered protein
                  properties. Here we develop Conformational Biasing (CB), a
                  rapid and streamlined computational method that utilizes
                  contrastive scoring by inverse folding models to predict
                  variants biased towards desired conformational states. We
                  validated CB across seven diverse deep mutational scanning
                  datasets, successfully predicting variants of K-Ras,
                  SARS-CoV-2 spike, β2 adrenergic receptor, and Src kinase with
                  improved conformation-specific functions including enhanced
                  effector binding or enzymatic activity. Furthermore, applying
                  CB to lipoic acid ligase, a conformation-switching bacterial
                  enzyme that has been used for the development of protein
                  labeling technologies, revealed a previously unknown mechanism
                  for conformational gating of sequence-specificity. Variants
                  biased toward the “open” conformation were highly promiscuous,
                  while “closed” conformation-biased variants were even more
                  specific than wild-type, enhancing the utility of LplA for
                  site-specific protein labeling with fluorophores in living
                  cells. The speed, simplicity, and versatility of CB (available
                  at: https://github.com/alicetinglab/ConformationalBiasing/ )
                  suggest that it may be broadly applicable for understanding
                  and engineering protein conformational dynamics, with
                  implications for basic research, biotechnology, and medicine.}

                  recent publications of RoseTTAFold All-Atom, AlphaFold3, and

                  structures of proteins interacting with small-molecules,

                  capabilities and broad potential, the current study presents
                  critical findings that question the adherence of these models
                  to fundamental physical principles. Through adversarial
                  examples based on established physical, chemical, and
                  biological principles, we demonstrate notable discrepancies in
                  protein-ligand structural predictions when subjected to
                  biologically and chemically plausible perturbations. These
                  discrepancies reveal a significant divergence from expected
                  physical behaviors, indicating potential overfitting to
                  particular data features within its training corpus. Our

                  supervision. DFMDock predicts both denoising forces and a
                  scalar energy, trained using force matching and energy
                  contrastive objectives. The predicted forces guide the reverse

                  without relying on a separately trained confidence model. On
                  the Docking Benchmark 5, DFMDock achieves a 32.8\% Oracle
                  success rate and 5.3\% Top-1 success rate, outperforming
                  DiffDock-PP (16.2\% and 4.3\%, respectively). Unlike
                  co-folding models, DFMDock does not require MSAs and
                  generalizes to unseen targets. In decoy ranking, its learned

                  confidence scores, producing funnel-shaped energy landscapes
                  enriched for near-native structures. These results suggest

                  epistasis, the dependence of a mutation’s effect on its
                  sequence context, as a lens to probe what PLMs capture about
                  proteins. Comparing PLM-derived scores with deep mutational
                  scanning data, we find that epistasis emerges naturally from
                  pretrained models, without supervision on experimental
                  fitness. Raw model scores align with residue–residue contacts,
                  indicating that PLMs internalize structural proximity.
                  Applying a nonlinear transformation to bring model outputs
                  onto the experimental scale, however, shifts the signal toward
                  functional couplings between distant sites. These findings
                  show that PLMs capture both structural and functional
                  dependencies from sequence data alone, and that epistasis
                  provides a powerful window into the biological principles

                  of new designs and methodologies. Here, we describe

                  of scale, speed and reproducibility of common in vitro protein
                  testing methods, enabling at least an order of magnitude
                  increase in throughput while reducing wetlab time.
                  Semi-Automated Protein Production (SAPP) is a rapid, modular,
                  scalable and cost-effective protocol, enabling up to
                  milligram-scale protein production, and standardized
                  characterization including yield, dispersity, and oligomeric
                  state of hundreds of designs per day, at the cost-equivalent
                  of a few DNA oligos per construct. End-to-end protocol
                  execution takes 48 hours, with about 6 hours spent benchside
                  using mostly standard laboratory equipment. This protocol has
                  become the standard at our institute, providing critical
                  experimental validation for dozens of projects spanning tens
                  of thousands of designs. Since at least 80\% of SAPP's total
                  cost comes from synthetic DNA, we also developed a scalable
                  demultiplexing protocol (DMX) to leverage oligo pools as input
                  DNA, providing a further 5-fold reduction in costs, enabling
                  >1000 designs to be purified and characterized in arrayed,
                  clonal format at a cost of \$5 per construct. By reframing

                  the application of costly, cumbersome technology. In this
                  work, we show that covalent nanopore sensing can be used for
                  the targeted detection of a reduced set of analytes in a
                  mixture. In this case aldehydes, which constitute ~5\% of
                  human volatiles, can be selectively detected by using
                  reversible thiol-aldehyde chemistry. Further, nanopore
                  engineering permits high-resolution detection, which allows
                  closely related aldehydes, including isomers, to be
                  distinguished. Differential sensing of members of other
                  chemical classes, such as mono alcohols, is also demonstrated
                  by leveraging their enzymatic conversion into aldehydes. Our
                  approach is compatible with the use of low-cost, portable,
                  user-friendly diagnostic devices applicable to a wide variety
                  of objectives, including pollutant monitoring, food and

                  significant implications in modulating cellular activities and
                  sensor development, but it remains a significant challenge due
                  to the complexities involved in designing stimuli-induced
                  conformational changes in proteins. Here, we report the
                  accurate de novo design of voltage-gated anion channels,
                  namely dVGACs. dVGACs adopt a 15-helix pentameric architecture
                  featuring arginine constrictions within the transmembrane span
                  and show voltage-dependent anions currents in patch-clamp
                  experiments. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of
                  dVGACs closely align with the design models. Cryo-EM
                  structures and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the
                  arginine constrictions undergo voltage-induced conformational
                  changes, serving as both a voltage sensor and a selectivity
                  filter as designed. Notably, the anion selectivity and voltage
                  sensitivity of dVGACs can be tuned through targeted mutations
                  for suppressing neuronal firing in situ. The ability to create

                  large datasets. However, aiming to perform well on all
                  possible proteins can limit a model's capacity to excel on any
                  specific one, whereas experimentalists typically need accurate
                  predictions for individual proteins they study, often not

                  propose a method that enables self-supervised customization of
                  protein language models to one target protein at a time, on

                  ProteinTTT achieves more accurate antibody-antigen loop

  abstract     = {ABSTRACT The accuracy of protein structure prediction models
                  such as AlphaFold2 is tightly coupled to the depth and quality
                  of multiple sequence alignments ( MSAs ), posing a persistent
                  challenge for proteins with few or no identifiable homologs.
                  We present GhostFold, a method for conjuring
                  structure-constrained synthetic MSAs from a single amino acid
                  sequence, bypassing the need for traditional homology
                  searches. Leveraging the ProstT5 protein language model and
                  the 3Di structural alphabet, GhostFold projects a query
                  sequence into a tokenized structural representation and
                  iteratively back-translates to generate an ensemble of
                  diverse, fold-consistent sequences. These synthetic alignments
                  ( pseudoMSAs ) encode emergent coevolutionary constraints that
                  are sufficient for high-accuracy structure prediction of
                  difficult targets such as orphan proteins and hypervariable
                  antibody loops. GhostFold consistently matches or exceeds the
                  performance of MSA-based and language model-based structure
                  predictors while being computationally lightweight and
                  independent of large sequence databases. Notably, we observe a
                  decoupling of confidence metrics (e.g., pLDDT) from prediction
                  accuracy when using pseudoMSAs, suggesting that AlphaFold2’s
                  internal confidence calibration is strongly influenced by the
                  statistical properties of natural sequence alignments. These
                  results establish that structure-guided synthetic MSAs can
                  functionally substitute for evolutionary data, offering a
                  scalable and generalizable solution to one of the central
                  limitations in computational structural biology. GhostFold
                  represents a shift from passive data mining to intelligent
                  sequence synthesis, redefining how structural priors are
                  encoded in deep learning-based protein folding.}

                  proteins during simulation, Martini is typically combined with
                  structure-based force fields such as elastic network models
                  (ENMs) or Gō models. While these approaches preserve global
                  folds and capture protein flexibility, their ability to
                  reproduce conformational dynamics remains unclear. Here, we
                  benchmark Martini combined with ENMs or Gō models on three
                  folded proteins and show that both approaches struggle to
                  sample the conformational space observed in atomistic
                  simulations, even when uniform interaction strengths or
                  equilibrium bond distances are adjusted. This limitation
                  arises from the assumption of a uniform interaction network,
                  in which all bond energies are equal. To overcome this, we
                  present a fully automated, perturbation-based optimization
                  approach for Gō networks, PoGō , that iteratively refines a
                  non-uniform Gō network against a pre-computed atomistic free
                  energy landscape in essential conformational space. Our
                  approach converges rapidly, yielding CG ensembles in close
                  agreement with reference atomistic simulations. As a
                  cross-validation, the optimization also improves the

                  design is the exploration of uncharted areas within the
                  protein structural space. However, the large degrees of
                  freedom of protein backbones complicate the sampling process
                  during protein design. Machine learning-based models have made
                  great strides in this problem, however due to their nature
                  they tend to exploit rather than explore the data distribution
                  used for training the neural networks. To address some of
                  these challenges, we propose a new coarse grained protein
                  structure representation generative method, DiffTopo , a
                  diffusion model which increases the sampling efficiency and
                  diversity. Combined with a backbone level protein generative
                  model like RFdiffusion, novel protein folds can be generated
                  rapidly, allowing for efficient exploration of the designable
                  topology space. Interestingly, we have discovered that by
                  mirroring the topological organization of native proteins
                  using a pipeline named MirrorTopo , we can readily expand the
                  known fold space. We generated and experimentally
                  characterized 30 different novel topologies from DiffTopo and
                  6 different novel mirror topologies from MirrorTopo. The
                  developed framework relying on low resolution sampling
                  provides new means for fold exploration challenges, which
                  could in principle enhance our knowledge of the first
                  principles of protein structure and folding, as well as create
                  new opportunities for functional design.}

  abstract     = {A half century of studying protein folding in vitro and
                  modeling it in silico has not provided us with a reliable
                  computational method to predict the native conformations of
                  proteins de novo, let alone identify the intermediates on
                  their folding pathways. In this Opinion article, we suggest
                  that the reason for this impasse is the over-reliance on
                  current physical models of protein folding that are based on
                  the assumption that proteins are able to fold spontaneously
                  without assistance. These models arose from studies conducted
                  in vitro on a biased sample of smaller, easier-to-isolate
                  proteins, whose native structures appear to be
                  thermodynamically stable. Meanwhile, the vast empirical data
                  on the majority of larger proteins suggests that once these
                  proteins are completely denatured in vitro, they cannot fold
                  into native conformations without assistance. Moreover, they
                  tend to lose their native conformations spontaneously and
                  irreversibly in vitro, and therefore such conformations must
                  be metastable. We propose a model of protein folding that is
                  based on the notion that the folding of all proteins in the
                  cell is mediated by the actions of the "protein folding
                  machine" that includes the ribosome, various chaperones, and
                  other components involved in co-translational or
                  post-translational formation, maintenance and repair of
                  protein native conformations in vivo. The most important and
                  universal component of the protein folding machine consists of
                  the ribosome in complex with the welcoming committee
                  chaperones. The concerted actions of molecular machinery in
                  the ribosome peptidyl transferase center, in the exit tunnel,
                  and at the surface of the ribosome result in the application
                  of mechanical and other forces to the nascent peptide,
                  reducing its conformational entropy and possibly creating
                  strain in the peptide backbone. The resulting high-energy
                  conformation of the nascent peptide allows it to fold very
                  fast and to overcome high kinetic barriers along the folding
                  pathway. The early folding intermediates in vivo are
                  stabilized by interactions with the ribosome and welcoming
                  committee chaperones and would not be able to exist in vitro
                  in the absence of such cellular components. In vitro
                  experiments that unfold proteins by heat or chemical treatment
                  produce denaturation ensembles that are very different from
                  folding intermediates in vivo and therefore have very limited
                  use in reconstructing the in vivo folding pathways. We
                  conclude that computational modeling of protein folding should
                  deemphasize the notion of unassisted thermodynamically
                  controlled folding, and should focus instead on the
                  step-by-step reverse engineering of the folding process as it
                  actually occurs in vivo. REVIEWERS: This article was reviewed

                  traversed in transitions from one low-lying state to

                  learning (DL) models excel at predicting well-ordered regions,
                  accurate prediction of loop regions, which often are flexible
                  and crucial for protein function, remains a significant
                  challenge. To address this, we introduce the Equivariant Loop
                  Evaluation Network (ELEN), a local model quality assessment
                  (MQA) method that is tailored towards evaluating the accuracy
                  of protein loops at the per-residue level. ELEN jointly
                  predicts three quality metrics, local Distance Difference Test
                  (lDDT), Contact Area Difference Score (CAD-score), and Root
                  Mean Squared Deviation (RMSD), by comparing predicted to
                  experimental reference structures. Learning these metrics
                  simultaneously enables ELEN to capture complementary
                  structural insights, providing a richer assessment of model
                  accuracy. The network operates at all-atom resolution and
                  employs 3D equivariant group convolutions to learn the local
                  geometric environment of each atom. By incorporating sequence
                  embeddings from large language models (LLMs), such as SaProt,
                  we enhance the sequence and evolutionary awareness of the
                  model. Furthermore, by informing ELEN with per-residue
                  physicochemical features, the model achieves competitive
                  accuracy relative to state-of-the-art MQA methods on the
                  Continuous Automated Model EvaluatiOn (CAMEO) benchmark.
                  Although ELEN was primarily developed for assessing loop
                  quality, its architecture also demonstrates strong potential
                  for general MQA tasks. We used ELEN to perform detailed
                  analysis, including identification of flexible or disordered
                  regions and assessment of structural effects from
                  single-residue mutations on three sets of redesigned enzymes.
                  We show that for all sets ELEN successfully identifies poor
                  design positions and thus serves as a powerful tool for
                  advancing both the study and modeling of loops in protein
                  structures.}

                  branch of molecular evolution that (i) uses 3D structural data
                  to trace evolutionary histories, and (ii) uses these
                  evolutionary relationships to explore the diversity of protein
                  structures and their ancestral functions. The appeal in
                  extracting phylogenetic information from protein structure
                  lies in the greater conservation of protein structure compared
                  with sequence, reflecting its resilience to mutation over long
                  evolutionary timescales. Leveraging this information is
                  particularly useful for examining relationships within the
                  "twilight zone"-a region of low protein sequence similarity
                  where it becomes challenging to resolve noise from signal.
                  Historically, the field has been constrained by the limited
                  availability of high-resolution structural data. However,
                  recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence have made
                  high-quality protein structural data widely accessible.
                  Although the methods for constructing phylogenetic trees from
                  protein structures have progressed significantly from
                  distance-based approaches used since the 1970s, this area of
                  research still lags behind the advanced probabilistic models
                  employed in sequence-based phylogenetics; particularly
                  Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. This article
                  reviews the current state of protein structural phylogenetics,
                  outlines methods for extracting evolutionary insights from
                  structural data, and highlights key applications and future
                  directions. Due to the surge of newly available structural
                  information, it is anticipated that sequence and structural
                  data will become routinely integrated in phylogenetic
                  analysis; poising us to venture further into the twilight zone

                  known to influence catalysis, but their mechanistic
                  contributions to the catalytic cycle remain poorly understood.
                  Here, we investigate the structural, functional, and
                  mechanistic impacts of distal and active-site mutations
                  discovered through directed evolution of the computationally
                  designed retro-aldolase RA95. Active-site mutations improve
                  catalytic efficiency by 3,600-fold, while distal mutations
                  alone offer no improvement. When combined with active-site
                  mutations, distal mutations further increase efficiency by
                  6-fold, demonstrating an epistatic effect. X-ray
                  crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that
                  distal mutations promote active site opening by altering loop
                  dynamics. Kinetic solvent viscosity effects and electric field
                  calculations show that distal mutations accelerate the

                  rate-limiting step to product release, which is further

                  shaping the active-site environment and facilitating the

                  signaling pathways. Despite recent progress in de novo design
                  of protein binders, there are no current methods for designing
                  binders that recognize phosphorylated proteins and peptides;
                  this is a challenging problem as phosphate groups are highly
                  charged, and phosphorylation often occurs within unstructured
                  regions. Here we introduce RoseTTAFold Diffusion 2 for
                  Molecular Interfaces (RFD2-MI), a deep generative framework
                  for the design of binders for protein, ligand, and covalently
                  modified protein targets. We demonstrate the power and
                  versatility of this method by designing binders for four
                  critical phosphotyrosine sites on three clinically relevant
                  targets: Cluster of Differentiation 3 (CD3ε), Epidermal Growth
                  Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Insulin Receptor (INSR).
                  Experimental characterization shows that the designs bind
                  their phospho-tyrosine containing targets with affinities
                  comparable to native binding sites and have negligible binding
                  to non-phosphorylated targets or phosphopeptides with
                  different sequences. X-ray crystal structures of generated
                  binders to CD3ε and EGFR are very close to the design models,
                  demonstrating the accuracy of the design approach. RFD2-MI
                  provides a generalizable all-atom diffusion framework for
                  probing and modulating phosphorylation-dependent signaling,
                  and more generally, for developing research tools and targeted
                  therapeutics against post-translationally modified proteins.}

                  structural motifs and functional domains. Individual neurons
                  show considerably less conceptual alignment, suggesting PLMs
                  store concepts in superposition. This superposition persists
                  across model scales and larger PLMs capture more interpretable

               are extensible to various proteins of interest and variants
               thereof. Performing protein purification in a 96-well plate
               format is fairly straightforward and thus amenable to scaling

                  alters protein hydration and solubility is an open question
                  since Kuntz and Kauzmann proposed pH-driven protein
                  desolvation in 1974. Here, in a series of high-resolution
                  cryo-electron microscopy structures of a protein complex at
                  different pH values (from pH 9.0 to 3.5) we examined thousands
                  of observable hydration sites. Cryo-EM data, in agreement with
                  constant-pH molecular dynamics simulations, show that nearly
                  half of protein-bound waters exchanged with the bulk solvent
                  upon acidification, with ~100 waters lost per pH unit per
                  molecule. The loss of waters was most significant around the
                  side chains of glutamate and aspartate residues while specific
                  polar residues, mostly asparagine, anchored persistent waters.
                  A positionally conserved hydration layer was observed across

                  Those waters displayed denser packing than less persistent
                  waters, forming a pH-independent solvation shell. Acid-induced
                  water exchange also displaced bound iron, providing a

                  Here we identify Hib, a previously unrecognized family of
                  hibernation factors widespread in Archaea. Deletion of hib in
                  Thermococcus barophilus delays recovery from stationary phase
                  and reduces 70S ribosome pools, establishing its role in
                  ribosome preservation. Hib displays a unique modular
                  architecture, combining a bacterial-like HPF/RaiA domain with
                  a Cystathionine Beta Synthase module. High-resolution cryo-EM
                  structures of reconstituted and in cell-extracted Hib:ribosome
                  complexes from Pyrococcus abyssi identify three conformations
                  encompassing the positions of tRNAs at A, P and E sites during
                  translation. Thus, Hib acts as a hibernation factor blocking
                  all states of the dynamic translation process, preserving the
                  ribosome from dissociation and degradation. Our findings
                  define Hib as a key hibernation factor in Archaea and provide
                  a framework for understanding ribosome dormancy and adaptation

                  rapidly growing field with transformative potential for
                  synthetic biology. Yet, progress has lagged behind that of
                  soluble proteins, largely due to limited understanding of the
                  fundamental principles governing MP folding, stability, and
                  solubility—and their integration into computational models.
                  Here, we use a cell-free expression system to bypass the
                  cytotoxicity of failed or insoluble designs and investigate
                  how sequence features influence the folding of synthetic
                  transmembrane β-barrels (TMBs). We find that even small,
                  idealized TMBs challenge classical protein design workflows:
                  sequences optimized solely for thermodynamic stability misfold
                  and aggregate, preventing membrane insertion. Instead of bulk
                  hydrophobicity, aggregation and β-sheet propensity emerge as
                  key determinants of membrane association. By designing better
                  folding variants of a synthetic TMB, we demonstrate that
                  suppressing aggregation-prone intermediates through local
                  destabilization of β-strands (“negative design”) significantly
                  improves folding efficiency. Strikingly, even substitutions
                  typically considered highly destabilizing, such as prolines or
                  polar threonines exposed to the bilayer core, can improve
                  folding when strategically positioned, without significantly
                  compromising thermodynamic stability. Based on these findings,
                  we propose a framework for joint optimization of native
                  stability and folding pathways for future MP and nanopore
                  design. Significance Statement Membrane proteins are essential
                  to biology and biotechnology, yet designing them from scratch
                  remains challenging. Using synthetic transmembrane β-barrels
                  and a cell-free expression system with lipid vesicles, we show
                  that conventional design strategies focused solely on native
                  state stabilization can lead to misfolding and aggregation. By
                  incorporating “negative design” features—specific mutations
                  that locally disrupt β-strand structure—we improve folding
                  efficiency without compromising stability. Remarkably, a
                  protein language model outperformed traditional energy-based
                  methods in predicting these beneficial mutations. Our findings
                  highlight the critical role of folding kinetics in membrane
                  protein design and introduce new principles for engineering
                  synthetic membrane proteins and β-barrel nanopores.}

                  methods have been devised to broaden the conformational

                  a method using random MSA column masking to reduce
                  co-evolutionary signals, enhancing structural diversity in
                  AF2-generated models. AFsample2 effectively predicts
                  alternative states for various proteins, producing
                  high-quality end states and diverse conformational ensembles.
                  In the OC23 dataset, alternate state models improved
                  (ΔTM>0.05) in 9 out of 23 cases without affecting preferred
                  state generation. Similar results were seen in 16 membrane
                  protein transporters, with 11 out of 16 targets showing
                  improvement. TM-score improvements to experimental end states
                  were substantial, sometimes exceeding 50\%, improving from
                  0.58 to 0.98. Additionally, AFsample2 increased the diversity
                  of intermediate conformations by 70\% compared to standard
                  AF2, producing highly confident models potentially
                  representing intermediate states. For four targets, predicted
                  intermediate states were structurally similar to known
                  structural homologs in the PDB, suggesting that they are true
                  intermediate states. These findings indicate that AFsample2
                  can used to provide structural insights into proteins with
                  multiple states, as well as potential paths between the

                  and associated computational methods for designing

                  adjacent to positively charged residues at binder-target

                  binding at low pH, and (ii) introducing buried
                  histidine-containing charged hydrogen-bonding networks in the
                  binder core such that the protein is destabilized under acidic
                  conditions. Using these methods, we designed binders that
                  dissociate at acidic pH against ephrin type-A receptor 2,
                  tumor necrosis factor receptor 2, interleukin-6, proprotein

                  of lysosomal trafficking receptors function as catalytic

                  different inputs could map to the same output and prevent
                  exact recovery of the input from a model's representations. In
                  this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove
                  mathematically that transformer language models mapping
                  discrete input sequences to their corresponding sequence of
                  continuous representations are injective and therefore
                  lossless, a property established at initialization and
                  preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result
                  empirically through billions of collision tests on six
                  state-of-the-art language models, and observe no collisions.
                  Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce SipIt, the
                  first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the
                  exact input text from hidden activations, establishing
                  linear-time guarantees and demonstrating exact invertibility

                  fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with

                  their native cellular membranes remains a substantial
                  challenge in structural biology. In this study, we present a
                  proton-detected solid-state NMR (ssNMR) approach, combined
                  with an optimized random partial protonation (RAP) labeling
                  strategy, to determine the high-resolution structure of the
                  large-conductance mechanosensitive channel (MscL) directly
                  within native E.coli membranes (backbone RMSD = 1.9 Å). Our
                  approach effectively suppresses background protein signals and
                  achieves high spectral resolution and sensitivity at moderate
                  MAS frequencies (40–60 kHz) by differentially tuning amide and
                  side-chain protonation levels. Using advanced recoupling
                  schemes, we obtained chemical shift assignments of side-chain
                  protons by 3D hCCH spectra and 1 H- 1 H distance restraints
                  from a series of 3D hNHH spectra. With 10\% protonation in
                  side-chains, the 1 H signals displayed linewidths of
                  approximately 50Hz, facilitating the extraction of 49
                  long-range distance restraints between amide and side-chain
                  protons, which are crucial for structural convergence.
                  Ambiguities in the assignment of weak signals corresponding to
                  distance restraints were resolved by integrating 3D hNHH
                  experimental data with CS-Rosetta structural modeling. The
                  resulting structure reveals a well-defined pentameric
                  assembly, with transmembrane helix packing consistent with
                  that observed in detergent environments. This study
                  demonstrates significant sensitivity advantages of 1
                  H-detected over 13 C-detected in situ ssNMR methods,
                  highlighting the potential of 1 H-detected ssNMR for the

                  primitive compositions yield stable, functional folds? Using
                  de novo design, we constructed three ancient protein
                  architectures using a reduced, evolution-inspired alphabet of
                  ten amino acids, e.g. lacking all basic and aromatic residues.
                  The resulting structures adopted their intended topologies and

                  understand protein folding as it occurs in vivo, it should be
                  modeled as an active, energy-dependent process, in which the
                  cellular protein-folding machine directly manipulates the
                  polypeptide. We conducted all-atom molecular dynamics
                  simulations of four protein domains, whose folding from the
                  extended state was augmented by the application of rotational
                  force to the C-terminal amino acid, while the movement of the
                  N-terminal amino acid was restrained. We have shown earlier
                  that such a simple manipulation of peptide backbone
                  facilitated the formation of native structures in diverse
                  α-helical peptides. In this study, the simulation protocol was
                  modified, to apply the backbone rotation and movement
                  restriction only for a short time at the start of simulation.
                  This transient application of a mechanical force to the
                  peptide is sufficient to accelerate, by at least an order of
                  magnitude, the folding of four protein domains from different
                  structural classes to their native or native-like
                  conformations. Our in silico experiments show that a compact
                  stable fold may be attained more readily when the motions of

                  models applied to identical structures generate divergent
                  outputs. These systematic differences reflect training data
                  characteristics rather than random variation, but their
                  patterns and malleability remain uncharacterised. We
                  quantified how training data modality shapes systematic
                  preferences across six architectures. Structure-conditioned
                  models retain minimal unexplained taxonomic variance ( < 3\%)
                  after controlling for measurable protein properties, while
                  sequence-only models show substantial residual taxonomic
                  dependence (19-25\%). This difference stems from distinct
                  preference patterns: Structure-conditioned models favour
                  compactness and stability, properties enriched in
                  experimentally tractable structures; sequence-only models bias
                  reflect organism identity more heavily when evaluating
                  sequence quality. These systematic preferences constrain
                  design space exploration in predictable ways. Generated
                  sequences converge toward model-specific biophysical profiles,
                  with both input template properties and training-derived
                  preferences jointly determining outcomes. Fine-tuning
                  demonstrates these patterns are malleable: training
                  ProteinMPNN on alkaline-adapted proteins redirects preferences
                  toward elevated isoelectric points and basic residue content
                  while preserving structural compatibility. Systematic bias
                  characterisation enables both prediction of design outcomes
                  and strategic modification for target applications. As protein
                  design tackles increasingly complex challenges, understanding
                  how training procedures encode systematic preferences becomes
                  essential for reliable engineering.}

                  composed of two structurally different hydrocarbon chains.
                  Among these, low-melting lipids possessing both a saturated
                  and unsaturated chain have been intensely studied because of
                  their biological abundance and influence on lipid rafts. In
                  contrast, much less is known about the biophysical effects of
                  mixed chains in high-melting lipids. Here, we investigated two
                  such lipids--MSPC (14:0-18:0 PC) and SMPC (18:0-14:0 PC)--to
                  determine how chain length mismatch and acyl chain position on
                  the glycerol backbone influence lateral organization. We
                  studied the temperature- and composition-dependent phase
                  behavior of liposomes composed of either mixed-chain or
                  symmetric-chain high-melting lipids plus DOPC and cholesterol,
                  using techniques sensitive to domain formation at both
                  microscopic and nanoscopic length scales. All studied mixtures
                  exhibited liquid-ordered (Lo) + liquid-disordered (Ld) phase
                  coexistence with domains that were visible in confocal
                  microscopy experiments. FRET measurements showed that all
                  mixtures also exhibited nanoscopic heterogeneity at
                  temperatures above the microscopic miscibility transition
                  temperature, and cryo-EM imaging further revealed bilayer
                  thickness variation consistent with coexisting Ld and Lo
                  phases. Both the microscopic miscibility transition
                  temperature, μm-Tmix, and its nanoscopic counterpart, nm-Tmix,
                  were strongly correlated with the melting transition
                  temperature of the saturated lipid; the sole exception was
                  SMPC/DOPC/Chol, whose μm-Tmix showed a significant negative
                  deviation from the expected value, implying an enhanced
                  propensity for nanoscopic phase separation in mixtures
                  containing this high-melting species. These results point to
                  strong effect of acyl chain position within mixed-chain

                  permeation through the narrow constriction of the cation
                  selectivity filter involves partial dehydration, as evidenced
                  by multiple Ca2+ binding sites captured using single-particle
                  cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In contrast, Mg2+ binds
                  outside of the selectivity filter through the water network by
                  remaining hydrated, thereby serving as a channel blocker.
                  Furthermore, we show that the lipid network around the
                  selectivity filter influences the stability of Mg2+ binding.
                  Our study details the critical transmembrane chemistry of
                  NMDAR for initiating neuroplasticity.},

                  sequence motifs that are known to be important in helix
                  packing. These motifs are a promising starting point for the
                  construction of artificial proteins, but their potential has
                  not yet been fully explored. Here, we study the impact of
                  introducing a common natural helix packing motif to the
                  transmembrane domain of a genetically-encoded and structurally
                  dynamic de novo membrane protein. The resulting construct is
                  an artificial four-helix bundle with lipophilic regions that
                  are defined only by the amino acids L, G, S, A and W. This
                  minimal proto-protein could be recombinantly expressed by
                  diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts and was found to
                  co-sediment with cellular membranes. The protein could be
                  extracted and purified in surfactant micelles and was
                  monodisperse and stable in vitro, with sufficient structural
                  definition to support the rapid binding of a heme cofactor.
                  The reduction in conformational diversity imposed by this
                  design also enhances the nascent peroxidase activity of the
                  protein-heme complex. Unexpectedly, strains of Escherichia
                  coli expressing this artificial protein specifically
                  accumulated zinc protoporphyrin IX, a rare cofactor that is
                  not used by natural metalloenzymes. Our results demonstrate
                  that simple sequence motifs can rigidify elementary membrane
                  proteins, and that orthogonal artificial membrane proteins can
                  influence the cofactor repertoire of a living cell. These
                  findings have implications for rational protein design and

                  dissected the crystallographic structures of membrane proteins
                  into a library of interacting helical pairs. The pairs were
                  clustered according to their three-dimensional similarity
                  (rmsd ≤1.5 Å), allowing 90\% of the library to be assigned to
                  clusters consisting of at least five members. Surprisingly,
                  three quarters of the helical pairs belong to one of five
                  tightly clustered motifs whose structural features can be
                  understood in terms of simple principles of helix–helix
                  packing. Thus, the universe of common transmembrane
                  helix-pairing motifs is relatively simple. The largest
                  cluster, which comprises 29\% of the library members, consists
                  of an antiparallel motif with left-handed packing angles, and
                  it is frequently stabilized by packing of small side chains
                  occurring every seven residues in the sequence. Right-handed
                  parallel and antiparallel structures show a similar tendency

                  spaced at four-residue intervals. Position-specific sequence

                  understand the determinants of aggregation and improve its

                  temperature and acidic stress in custom libraries of small
                  protein domains (40-72 amino acids) using a high-throughput,

                  data (Pearson’s r = 0.65-0.79), supporting the use of
                  multiplexed approaches to study aggregation. Using machine
                  learning, we identified sequence and structural features that
                  correlate with aggregation and fine-tuned the protein language

                  model can also be used to derive the forces that act on
                  molecular systems. However, while classical diffusion sampling
                  usually recovers the training distribution, the corresponding
                  energy-based interpretation of the learned score is often
                  inconsistent with this distribution, even for low-dimensional
                  toy systems. We trace this inconsistency to inaccuracies of
                  the learned score at very small diffusion timesteps, where the
                  model must capture the correct evolution of the data

                  the Fokker--Planck equation, which governs the evolution of
                  the score. We interpret this deviation as one source of the

                  model with a Fokker--Planck-derived regularization term to

                  reliability, computational design methods have been applied to
                  improve therapeutics and enzymes for green chemistry and have
                  generated vaccine antigens, antivirals and drug-delivery
                  nano-vehicles. Moreover, the high success of design methods
                  reflects an increased understanding of basic rules that govern
                  the relationships among protein sequence, structure and
                  function. However, de novo design is still limited mostly to
                  α-helix bundles, restricting its potential to generate
                  sophisticated enzymes and diverse protein and small-molecule
                  binders. Designing complex protein structures is a challenging
                  but necessary next step if we are to realize our objective of
                  generating new-to-nature activities.},

                  engineering. Although powerful, it is iterative and

                  gained at the cost of other essential properties, such as
                  specificity and stability. Here, we present a scalable
                  structure- and energy-based strategy, called LAffAb, that
                  starts from a crystallographic structure of the bound
                  antibody-antigen complex and introduces combinations of
                  mutations to optimize the energy. A combinatorial mutation
                  library comprising 7,000 variants with up to nine mutations
                  results in large gains of up to 1,000-fold in affinity while
                  co-optimizing antibody stability. Surprisingly, the library
                  does not converge on a single solution; instead, it favors

                  LAffAb can be used to select stable, specific, and
                  high-affinity binders and to improve our understanding of

                  as symmetrical assemblies of identical subunits, from ion
                  channels that gate cellular signals to metabolic enzymes that
                  catalyze life’s essential reactions. Here, we reveal that
                  single-sequence protein language models (pLMs), trained solely
                  on individual protein sequences, implicitly learn the
                  interface contacts of homo-oligomeric assemblies. As models
                  grow larger, their ability to predict inter-subunit contacts
                  continues to improve, whereas the accuracy for single-chain
                  predictions shows only minimal gains. The largest ESM2 model
                  can accurately distinguish genuine biological interfaces from
                  crystallographic artifacts. MSA Pairformer and ESM2-15B
                  perform comparably when broad sets of homologs are used, but
                  restricting alignments to closer evolutionary neighbors
                  reveals a clear difference: MSA Pairformer reaches an
                  interface contact recovery rate of 0.44 compared with 0.33 for
                  ESM2-15B. We hypothesized that one contributing factor is how
                  models implicitly cluster homologous proteins. Comparing
                  evolutionary constraints extracted from pLMs, we find
                  correlation between homologs decrease as model size increases,
                  consistent with larger models partitioning families into
                  finer-grained subclusters and better separating distinct
                  oligomeric interfaces. When models fail to detect known
                  interfaces, these discrepancies may reflect annotation errors,
                  proteins that adopt multiple assembly conformations, or
                  intrinsic model limitations. Overall, our findings show that
                  statistical patterns learned by pLMs encode key aspects of
                  homo-oligomeric assembly organization and provide a basis for
                  understanding how such interfaces diversify across evolution,
                  even though structure is conserved over large evolutionary
                  distances, oligomeric assembly may not be.}

                  are becoming a popular tool to define an effective energy
                  model for complex systems, either incorporating electronic
                  structure effects at the atomistic resolution, or effectively
                  renormalizing part of the atomistic degrees of freedom at a
                  coarse-grained resolution. One main criticism regarding neural
                  network potentials is that their inferred energy is less
                  interpretable than in traditional approaches, which use
                  simpler and more transparent functional forms. Here we address
                  this problem by extending tools recently proposed in the
                  nascent field of explainable artificial intelligence to
                  coarse-grained potentials based on graph neural networks. With
                  these tools, neural network potentials can be practically
                  decomposed into n-body interactions, providing a human
                  understandable interpretation without compromising predictive
                  power. We demonstrate the approach on three different
                  coarse-grained systems including two fluids (methane and
                  water) and the protein NTL9. The obtained interpretations
                  suggest that well-trained neural network potentials learn
                  physical interactions, which are consistent with fundamental
                  principles. Machine-learned force fields are becoming
                  increasingly popular but suffer from their “black-box” nature.

                  inverse protein folding (IPF) by not only recovering a
                  sequence compatible with a given backbone geometry but also
                  generating a range of new sequences that satisfy the
                  physicochemical constraints required for a stable fold with a
                  specified (often designed) function. Recent progress has
                  incorporated biochemical properties as discrete per-residue
                  features, but such localized signals cannot represent the
                  continuous hydrophobic and electrostatic environments that
                  span protein surfaces and interior volumes. Here we introduce
                  BC-DESIGN, a biochemistry-aware inverse design framework that
                  integrates geometric structure with smoothly varying
                  hydrophobicity and charge properties. These properties are
                  represented independently of residue coordinates on compact
                  point clouds sampled throughout protein surfaces and
                  interiors. This formulation provides a natural spatial
                  description of physicochemical environments and enriches
                  structural cues without specifying amino-acid identities. On
                  the CATH 4.2 benchmark, BC-DESIGN achieves 90\% sequence
                  recovery and generalizes robustly across protein lengths,
                  contact-order regimes, and major fold classes. Masking
                  experiments further demonstrate an interpretable
                  fidelity-diversity control: full biochemical context yields
                  high-fidelity reconstructions, whereas withholding information
                  enables exploratory variant generation. Beyond diagnostic
                  benchmarks, BC-DESIGN demonstrably improves functional design
                  outcomes across diverse settings. It increases
                  enzyme-substrate affinity, enhances peptide-receptor design
                  accuracy, and achieves state-of-the-art recovery and

                  computational biology, enabling advances in therapeutic
                  molecule discovery and enzyme engineering. Existing
                  diffusion-based generative models typically operate in
                  Cartesian coordinate space, where adding noise disrupts strict
                  geometric constraints such as fixed bond lengths and angles,
                  often producing physically invalid structures. To address this
                  limitation, we propose a Torsion-Space Diffusion Model that
                  generates protein backbones by denoising torsion angles,
                  ensuring perfect local geometry by construction. A
                  differentiable forward-kinematics module reconstructs 3D
                  coordinates with fixed 3.8 Angstrom backbone bond lengths
                  while a constrained post-processing refinement optimizes
                  global compactness via Radius of Gyration (Rg) correction,
                  without violating bond constraints. Experiments on standard
                  PDB proteins demonstrate 100\% bond-length accuracy and
                  significantly improved structural compactness, reducing Rg
                  error from 70\% to 18.6\% compared to Cartesian diffusion
                  baselines. Overall, this hybrid torsion-diffusion plus
                  geometric-refinement framework generates physically valid and
                  compact protein backbones, providing a promising path toward

                  generate novel sequences with desired functions remains
                  challenging. Here, we show that Evo, a genomic language model,
                  can leverage genomic context to perform function-guided design
                  that accesses novel regions of sequence space. By learning
                  semantic relationships across prokaryotic genes2, Evo enables
                  a genomic 'autocomplete' in which a DNA prompt encoding
                  genomic context for a function of interest guides the
                  generation of novel sequences enriched for related functions,
                  which we refer to as 'semantic design'. We validate this
                  approach by experimentally testing the activity of generated
                  anti-CRISPR proteins and type II and III toxin-antitoxin
                  systems, including de novo genes with no significant sequence
                  similarity to natural proteins. In-context design of proteins
                  and non-coding RNAs with Evo achieves robust activity and high
                  experimental success rates even in the absence of structural
                  priors, known evolutionary conservation or task-specific
                  fine-tuning. We then use Evo to complete millions of prompts
                  to produce SynGenome, a database containing over 120 billion
                  base pairs of artificial intelligence-generated genomic
                  sequences that enables semantic design across many functions.
                  More broadly, these results demonstrate that generative
                  genomics with biological language models can extend beyond

                  and thus structural studies of static macromolecules are often
                  complemented by biophysical analysis. Moreover, the common
                  strategy of utilizing mutants or crosslinking probes to

                  multivalency and intrinsic disorder that enable condensate
                  formation are found not only in cytosolic and nuclear
                  proteins, but also in membrane-associated proteins. The ABC
                  transporter Rv1747, which is important for Mycobacterium
                  tuberculosis (Mtb) growth in infected hosts, has a cytoplasmic
                  regulatory module consisting of 2 phosphothreonine-binding
                  Forkhead-associated domains joined by an intrinsically
                  disordered linker with multiple phospho-acceptor threonines.
                  Here we demonstrate that the regulatory modules of Rv1747 and
                  its homolog in Mycobacterium smegmatis form liquid-like
                  condensates as a function of concentration and

                  condensates. The Rv1747 regulatory module also phase-separates
                  on supported lipid bilayers and forms dynamic foci when
                  expressed heterologously in live yeast and M. smegmatis cells.
                  Consistent with these observations, single-molecule

                  tools often miss proteins related by topological
                  rearrangements, particularly circular permutation (CP), where
                  proteins share identical global folds but differ in the
                  positioning of their termini. We introduce a circular
                  permutation-invariant graph neural network (CIRPIN) that
                  addresses this limitation through a novel data augmentation
                  strategy using synthetic circular permutations (synCPs). We
                  demonstrate that CIRPIN learns representations of proteins
                  that are invariant to circular permutation, enabling it to
                  identify similar proteins within the Structural Classification
                  of Proteins - extended (SCOPe) and AlphaFold Cluster
                  Representatives (AFDB-ClustR) databases. Leveraging the speed

                  tools, we search these databases and uncover thousands of
                  novel protein pairs related by circular permutation. Notably,
                  we discover that PDZ domains exist naturally in four

                  sensing applications owing to its unique architecture. This
                  architecture features an unusual, constricted N terminus in
                  the pore center, proposed to regulate substrate transport,
                  although its dynamic role remains poorly understood.
                  Therefore, we investigate the CymA conformational dynamics
                  using protein engineering, electrical recordings, and
                  molecular dynamics simulations. We engineered a mutant,
                  "stapled CymA" with the N terminus confined within the pore
                  lumen by a disulfide bond, restricting large cyclic sugar
                  translocation while facilitating passage of small peptides.
                  The disruption of this disulfide bond enables the transition
                  to "unstapled CymA," restoring N terminus dynamic flexibility,
                  facilitating cyclic sugar translocation. This conformational
                  control of the pore enables dual-mode sensing of small and
                  large analytes. Based on these insights, we engineered a
                  superior CymA featuring a dynamic, untethered N terminus for
                  single-molecule detection of various cyclic sugars. In this
                  design, the electrostatic interactions between the N terminus
                  and the pore barrel are disrupted, thereby minimizing gating
                  and facilitating effective sensing. These findings establish N
                  terminus flexibility as a tunable structural element for
                  regulating molecular transport and offer an advanced strategy
                  for designing dynamic nanopores for sensing.},

                  solution, we propose Ledidi, a computational approach that
                  rephrases the design of genomic edits as a continuous
                  optimization problem where the goal is to produce the desired
                  outcome as measured by one or more predictive models using as
                  few edits from an initial sequence as possible. When applied

                  that Ledidi can quickly design edits to precisely control
                  transcription factor binding, chromatin accessibility,
                  transcription, and enhancer activity across several species.
                  By using several models simultaneously, Ledidi can
                  programatically design edits that exhibit multiple desired

                  spectrum of outcomes, and demonstrate the practical benefits

                  computational protein design has become a widely accessible
                  technique. Nowadays, it is possible to perform both sequence
                  and structure design in a matter of minutes, making the
                  technology attractive to the broader scientific community. In
                  protein design campaigns, one of the most common in silico
                  strategies to evaluate how well a sequence encodes a target
                  structure is the so-called self-consistency or refolding
                  pipeline. In this approach, a structure prediction model is
                  used to refold the designed sequence to probe whether it is
                  compatible with the intended structure, and is evaluated via
                  two metrics linked to experimental success: the confidence
                  score of the predicted structure (pLDDT) and the
                  self-consistency root-mean-square deviation (scRMSD), which
                  measures how closely the refolded structure matches the
                  target. In this work, we systematically evaluate how different
                  models and structure prediction settings impact these metrics,
                  and to what extent they can be used to reliably filter
                  sequence design candidates. We show that evolutionary
                  information can obscure folding models' abilities to assess
                  sequence-structure compatibility, reducing the predictive
                  performance of refolding metrics for experimental success,
                  particularly for designs that share homology with natural
                  sequences. We further highlight limitations of refolding
                  metrics, including their sensitivity to structural features,
                  such as flexibility. Our findings raise awareness of potential
                  pitfalls in refolding-based evaluation and support more
                  informed use of these metrics in protein design campaigns.},

                  in biochemistry, but physical inaccuracies limit their
                  utility. One class of models uses energy functions rooted in
                  classical mechanics. The standard datasets used to train these
                  models are limited in diversity, pointing to a need for new
                  training data. Here, we sought to explore a new paradigm for
                  training an energy function, where the Rosetta energy function
                  was used to design de novo proteins. Experimental results on
                  these designs were then used to identify failure modes of
                  design, which were subsequently used as a guiding principle to
                  retrain the energy function. Specifically, we examined a
                  diverse set of de novo protein designs experimentally tested
                  for their ability to stably fold, identifying unstable designs
                  that were predicted to be stable by the Rosetta energy
                  function. Using deep mutational scanning, we identified single
                  amino-acid mutations that rescued the stability of these
                  designs, providing insight into common failure modes of the
                  energy function. We identified one key failure mode, involving
                  steric clashing in protein cores. We identified similar
                  overpacking when using Rosetta to refine high-resolution
                  protein crystal structures, quantified the degree of
                  overpacking, and refit a small set of energy-function
                  parameters to better recapitulate native-like packing.
                  Following fitting, we largely eliminated the failure mode in
                  the refinement task, while retaining performance on other
                  benchmarks, resulting in an updated version of the Rosetta
                  energy function. This work shows how learning from protein
                  designs can guide energy-function development.},

                  barriers that separate these states. For most dynamic
                  proteins, the molecular details of the energy barriers are not
                  known, implying a fundamental limit to the ability of protein
                  design methods to engineer beneficial mutations without
                  disrupting activity. We hypothesized that designing mutations
                  that are compatible with structurally distinct equilibrium
                  conformations may enable a reliable stability design. We focus
                  on periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs), a superfamily of
                  dynamic proteins that change conformation from open to closed
                  states in response to binding their small-molecule ligands. We
                  find that the evolutionary constrained space of allowed
                  mutations computed for one conformation is incompatible with
                  that for the other. Therefore, putative conformational hinge
                  points and interface residues were additionally constrained,
                  and incompatible mutations were filtered out. Starting from
                  four different PBPs, we designed a total of 16 stabilized
                  variants with 7-28 mutations each. Our results show that
                  design based on a single conformation with evolutionary
                  constraints is not sufficient to maintain a wild-type-like
                  binding affinity. Conversely, using a subset of mutations
                  compatible with both conformations and structural constraints

                  processes, including ion transport, intercellular
                  communication, and antibiotic resistance. Ensuring their
                  accurate orientation within lipid bilayers is essential for
                  reliable molecular simulations and structural analyses. We
                  introduce MemPrO, a robust tool designed to orient a wide
                  range of membrane-associated proteins with precision. While
                  existing tools perform well in standard scenarios, they often
                  struggle with complex configurations such as multibilayer
                  systems or peripheral membrane proteins. MemPrO addresses
                  these limitations by delivering detailed orientation data for
                  proteins in both single and double membrane environments. In
                  addition to mapping spatial arrangements relative to lipid
                  bilayers, MemPrO incorporates advanced analytical features,
                  including membrane curvature analysis. It also extends its
                  capability to predict the position and orientation of the
                  bacterial cell wall. By integrating these features, MemPrO
                  significantly enhances our ability to model and interpret the
                  intricate architecture of cellular envelopes. This supports
                  both fundamental research and the development of novel
                  therapeutic strategies through a deeper understanding of

                  in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and have shown
                  great success in image synthesis, video generation, molecular
                  design, and protein structure prediction. For biophysical
                  problems, such as protein folding and association, a
                  fundamental question in diffusion-based methods is how their
                  learned functions correspond to thermodynamics. In this paper,
                  we study diffusion models through the lens of theoretical
                  biophysics, analyzing their underlying formulation of
                  potentials and exploring their applications in scoring protein
                  interactions. We develop simple theories rooted in statistical
                  physics that relate thermodynamic potentials to the negative
                  log of the probability of observing a system in a particular
                  state. We include dimensional analysis of diffusion model
                  equations and a table mapping AI and physics jargon. We then
                  test a diffusion model’s ability to capture learned energies
                  as negative log-likelihood values, − log p 0 ( x 0 ), by
                  integrating over the diffusion-generated path or a probability
                  flow path. We test these integrals on a simple 1D Gaussian
                  mixture diffusion model and a protein-docking diffusion model,
                  DFMDock. In the 1D case, we find that integration over both
                  diffusion and flow paths can accurately recover ground truth
                  probabilities. When we extract the learned docking energies
                  for cases where DFMDock succeeds, we observe energy funnels
                  with the minimum energy near the experimental docked
                  structure, like those we observe with Rosetta, an empirically
                  tuned physics-based biomolecular modeling suite. The learned
                  energy performs comparably or outperforms Rosetta interface
                  energy in 6 out of 25 cases at ranking the correctness of
                  docked poses. These data show that we can extract a relevant
                  learned energy function from a diffusion model and compare it
                  to physical energy functions.}

                  engineering. Although powerful, it is iterative and

                  gained at the cost of other essential properties, such as
                  specificity and stability. Here, we present a scalable
                  structure- and energy-based strategy, called LAffAb, that
                  starts from a crystallographic structure of the bound
                  antibody-antigen complex and introduces combinations of
                  mutations to optimize the energy. A combinatorial mutation
                  library comprising 7,000 variants with up to nine mutations
                  results in large gains of up to 1,000-fold in affinity while

                  component, BamA, is a β-barrel protein with an N-terminal
                  periplasmic extension comprising five polypeptide
                  transport-associated (POTRA) domains. Whilst BamA's structure

                  sites with a strong LPS interaction site located adjacent to
                  the β-seam region of the FusA β-barrel. The requirement of
                  lipid binding for successful structure determination indicates
                  a stabilisation of the protein, which in turn suggests a
                  potential method for solving other, small OMPs and membrane
                  proteins. Further, it hints at how LPS may mediate protein
                  conformation and thus how LPS and OMPs can work in concert to
                  maintain a structural and functional OM.},

                  This article explores ways in which festival organizers may
                  contribute to social inclusion goals through a qualitative
                  phenomenological study of music festivals. Findings suggest
                  that these festival organizers may contribute to social
                  inclusion across four areas of society—consumption,
                  production, political engagement, and social interaction or
                  communitas—through factors such as providing opportunities for
                  local participation, learning new skills, and access to
                  education about social justice. However, it appears that these
                  festival organizers tended to direct their social inclusion
                  efforts toward portable communities, focusing on attendees but

                  ability to embrace the local community in its broadest sense,

                  techniques to specifically modulate protein activity within
                  living systems and in engineered biomaterials are needed to
                  better interrogate fundamental cell signalling and guide
                  advanced decisions of biological fate. Here we establish a
                  generalizable strategy to rapidly and irreversibly activate
                  protein function with full spatiotemporal control. Through the
                  development of a genetically encoded and light-activated
                  SpyLigation (LASL), bioactive proteins can be stably
                  reassembled from non-functional split fragment pairs following

                  proteins with precise affinity and specificity. The successful
                  application of engineered proteins often depends on
                  high-stability binding to their target. In recent years,
                  various approaches have enabled proteins to form irreversible
                  covalent interactions with protein targets. However, the rate
                  of such reactions is a major limitation to their use. Infinite
                  affinity refers to the ideal where such covalent interaction
                  occurs at the diffusion limit. Prototypes of infinite affinity
                  pairs have been achieved using nonnatural reactive groups.
                  After library-based evolution and rational design, here we
                  establish a peptide-protein pair composed of the regular 20
                  amino acids that link together through an amide bond at a rate
                  approaching the diffusion limit. Reaction occurs in a few
                  minutes with both partners at low nanomolar concentration.
                  Stopped flow fluorimetry illuminated the conformational
                  dynamics involved in docking and reaction. Hydrogen-deuterium
                  exchange mass spectrometry gave insight into the
                  conformational flexibility of this split protein and the
                  process of enhancing its reaction rate. We applied this
                  reactive pair for specific labeling of a plasma membrane
                  target in 1 min on live mammalian cells. Sensitive and
                  specific detection was also confirmed by Western blot in a
                  range of model organisms. The peptide-protein pair allowed
                  reconstitution of a critical mechanotransmitter in the cytosol
                  of mammalian cells, restoring cell adhesion and migration.
                  This simple genetic encoding for rapid irreversible reaction
                  should provide diverse opportunities to enhance protein
                  function by rapid detection, stable anchoring, and
                  multiplexing of protein functionality.},

                  However, connecting at a loop is difficult because of lower
                  flexibility and variable environment. Here, we have developed
                  DogCatcher, a protein that forms a spontaneous isopeptide bond
                  with DogTag peptide. DogTag/DogCatcher was generated initially
                  by splitting a Streptococcus pneumoniae adhesin. We optimized
                  DogTag/DogCatcher through rational design and evolution,
                  increasing reaction rate by 250-fold and establishing
                  millimolar solubility of DogCatcher. When fused to a protein
                  terminus, DogTag/DogCatcher reacts slower than
                  SpyTag003/SpyCatcher003. However, inserted in loops of a

                  SpyTag003. Like many membrane proteins, the ion channel TRPC5
                  has no surface-exposed termini. DogTag in a TRPC5
                  extracellular loop allowed normal calcium flux and specific
                  covalent labeling on cells in 1 min. DogTag/DogCatcher reacts
                  under diverse conditions, at nanomolar concentrations, and to
                  98\% conversion. Loop-friendly ligation should expand the

                  has important roles in various immune responses, which are
                  mediated through its two receptors, TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and
                  TNFR2. Antibody-based therapy against TNF is used clinically
                  to treat several chronic autoimmune diseases; however, such
                  treatment sometimes results in serious side effects, which are
                  thought to be caused by the blocking of signals from both
                  TNFRs. Therefore, knowledge of the structural basis for the
                  recognition of TNF by each receptor would be invaluable in
                  designing TNFR-selective drugs. Here, we solved the 3.0
                  angstrom resolution structure of the TNF-TNFR2 complex, which
                  provided insight into the molecular recognition of TNF by
                  TNFR2. Comparison to the known TNFR1 structure highlighted
                  several differences between the ligand-binding interfaces of
                  the two receptors. Additionally, we also demonstrated that
                  TNF-TNFR2 formed aggregates on the surface of cells, which may
                  be required for signal initiation. These results may

                  of jointly understanding protein sequences, structure, and
                  function. Existing protein structure tokenizers create tokens
                  by pooling information from local neighborhoods, an approach
                  that limits their performance on generative and representation
                  tasks. In this work, we present a method for global
                  tokenization of protein structures in which successive tokens
                  contribute increasing levels of detail to a global
                  representation. This change resolves several issues with
                  generative models based on local protein tokenization: it
                  mitigates error accumulation, provides embeddings without
                  sequence-reduction operations, and allows task-specific
                  adaptation of a tokenized sequence's information content. We
                  validate our method on reconstruction, generative, and
                  representation tasks and demonstrate that it matches or
                  outperforms existing models based on local protein structure
                  tokenizers. We show how adaptive tokens enable inference
                  criteria based on information content, which boosts
                  designability. We validate representations generated from our
                  tokenizer on CATH classification tasks and demonstrate that
                  non-linear probing on our tokenized sequences outperforms
                  equivalent probing on representations from other tokenizers.
                  Finally, we demonstrate how our method supports zero-shot
                  protein shrinking and affinity maturation.}

                  essential for bile acid efflux in enterohepatic circulation3,
                  has long defied mechanistic elucidation. Here we present
                  cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human Ostα/β in
                  apo and substrate-bound states at 2.6-3.1 Å resolution,
                  revealing a distinctive membrane protein architecture that
                  defines a new transporter class. Ostα/β forms a symmetric
                  tetramer of heterodimers, with each Ostα subunit showing a new
                  seven-transmembrane fold, augmented by a single transmembrane
                  helix of Ostβ. This architecture is stabilized by extensive
                  lipid modifications, including a palmitoylated cysteine-rich
                  motif that forms a lateral substrate-binding groove. The
                  structures uncover a unique transport pathway featuring two
                  substrate-binding sites connected by an amphipathic
                  helix-gated conduit. This design, conserved in the
                  evolutionarily related TMEM184 family, suggests an ancient
                  mechanism for substrate translocation. Electrophysiological
                  studies demonstrate voltage-sensitive, bidirectional transport
                  driven by electrochemical gradients, elucidating the efflux
                  role of Ostα/β in vivo. Lipid interactions, notably
                  palmitoylation-dependent trafficking, emerge as critical for
                  stability and function. These findings clarify the molecular
                  mechanism of Ostα/β, provide a structural basis for
                  disease-associated mutations4,5 and establish a paradigm for

                  YTK on OT-2, 11/12 on Flex, and 8/13 with STK on OT-2.
                  High-throughput assemblies were also performed with six parts

                  particularly large outdoor music festivals, are leading in
                  greening their events. This paper explores the drivers of, and
                  barriers to, greening festivals and considers how events might
                  be a vehicle for promoting sustainable behaviour. The
                  application of the Mair and Jago model is tested. Long
                  interviews were conducted with managers of six UK and
                  Australian festivals that have won awards for their “green”
                  performance and an organisation that encourages the greening
                  of festivals. Findings suggest that managers of these
                  festivals act both as a champion and a steward of greening and
                  that the key drivers of festival greening are the personal
                  values or ethos of the manager and/or the organisation, demand
                  for greening from stakeholders and a desire to educate and act
                  as an advocate of green issues. Barriers to greening festivals
                  included the financial costs, lack of time and control over
                  festival venues and the inability to source appropriate
                  suppliers or supplies. Further research could explore these
                  issues in other events contexts and examine whether events
                  leave a lasting legacy in terms of influencing environmental
                  behaviour.},

                  a significant challenge in structural biology. Here, we
                  leverage the internal pairwise representation of AlphaFold2
                  (AF2) to train a model, AF2BIND, to accurately predict
                  small-molecule-binding residues given only a target protein.
                  AF2BIND uses 20 “bait” amino acids to optimally extract the
                  binding signal in the absence of a small-molecule ligand. We
                  find that the AF2 pair representation outperforms other
                  neural-network representations for binding-site prediction.
                  Moreover, unique combinations of the 20 bait amino acids are

  abstract     = {INTRODUCTION The subcellular compartmentalization of
                  eukaryotic cells requires selective transport of folded
                  proteins and protein-nucleic acid complexes. Embedded in
                  nuclear envelope pores, which are generated by the
                  circumscribed fusion of the inner and outer nuclear membranes,
                  nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are the sole bidirectional
                  gateways for nucleocytoplasmic transport. The ~110-MDa human
                  NPC is an ~1000-protein assembly that comprises multiple
                  copies of ~34 different proteins, collectively termed
                  nucleoporins. The symmetric core of the NPC is composed of an
                  inner ring encircling the central transport channel and outer
                  rings formed by Y‑shaped coat nucleoporin complexes (CNCs)
                  anchored atop both sides of the nuclear envelope. The outer
                  rings are decorated with compartment‑specific asymmetric
                  nuclear basket and cytoplasmic filament nucleoporins, which
                  establish transport directionality and provide docking sites
                  for transport factors and the small guanosine triphosphatase
                  Ran. The cytoplasmic filament nucleoporins also play an
                  essential role in the irreversible remodeling of messenger
                  ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) as they exit the central
                  transport channel. Unsurprisingly, the NPC's cytoplasmic face
                  represents a hotspot for disease‑associated mutations and is
                  commonly targeted by viral virulence factors. RATIONALE
                  Previous studies established a near-atomic composite structure
                  of the human NPC's symmetric core by combining (i) biochemical
                  reconstitution to elucidate the interaction network between
                  symmetric nucleoporins, (ii) crystal and single-particle
                  cryo-electron microscopy structure determination of
                  nucleoporins and nucleoporin complexes to reveal their
                  three-dimensional shape and the molecular details of their
                  interactions, (iii) quantitative docking in cryo-electron
                  tomography (cryo-ET) maps of the intact human NPC to uncover
                  nucleoporin stoichiometry and positioning, and (iv) cell‑based
                  assays to validate the physiological relevance of the
                  biochemical and structural findings. In this work, we extended
                  our approach to the cytoplasmic filament nucleoporins to
                  reveal the near-atomic architecture of the cytoplasmic face of
                  the human NPC. RESULTS Using biochemical reconstitution, we
                  elucidated the protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction
                  networks of the human and Chaetomium thermophilum cytoplasmic
                  filament nucleoporins, establishing an evolutionarily
                  conserved heterohexameric cytoplasmic filament nucleoporin
                  complex (CFNC) held together by a central heterotrimeric
                  coiled‑coil hub that tethers two separate mRNP‑remodeling
                  complexes. Further biochemical analysis and determination of a
                  series of crystal structures revealed that the
                  metazoan‑specific cytoplasmic filament nucleoporin NUP358 is
                  composed of 16 distinct domains, including an N‑terminal
                  S‑shaped α‑helical solenoid followed by a coiled‑coil
                  oligomerization element, numerous Ran‑interacting domains, an
                  E3 ligase domain, and a C‑terminal prolyl‑isomerase domain.
                  Physiologically validated quantitative docking into cryo-ET
                  maps of the intact human NPC revealed that pentameric NUP358
                  bundles, conjoined by the oligomerization element, are
                  anchored through their N‑terminal domains to the central stalk
                  regions of the CNC, projecting flexibly attached domains as
                  far as ~600 Å into the cytoplasm. Using cell‑based assays, we
                  demonstrated that NUP358 is dispensable for the architectural
                  integrity of the assembled interphase NPC and RNA export but
                  is required for efficient translation. After NUP358
                  assignment, the remaining 4-shaped cryo‑ET density matched the
                  dimensions of the CFNC coiled‑coil hub, in close proximity to
                  an outer-ring NUP93. Whereas the N-terminal NUP93 assembly
                  sensor motif anchors the properly assembled related
                  coiled‑coil channel nucleoporin heterotrimer to the inner
                  ring, biochemical reconstitution confirmed that the NUP93
                  assembly sensor is reused in anchoring the CFNC to the
                  cytoplasmic face of the human NPC. By contrast, two C.
                  thermophilum CFNCs are anchored by a divergent mechanism that
                  involves assembly sensors located in unstructured portions of
                  two CNC nucleoporins. Whereas unassigned cryo‑ET density
                  occupies the NUP358 and CFNC binding sites on the nuclear
                  face, docking of the nuclear basket component ELYS established
                  that the equivalent position on the cytoplasmic face is
                  unoccupied, suggesting that mechanisms other than steric
                  competition promote asymmetric distribution of nucleoporins.
                  CONCLUSION We have substantially advanced the biochemical and
                  structural characterization of the asymmetric nucleoporins'
                  architecture and attachment at the cytoplasmic and nuclear
                  faces of the NPC. Our near‑atomic composite structure of the
                  human NPC's cytoplasmic face provides a biochemical and
                  structural framework for elucidating the molecular basis of
                  mRNP remodeling, viral virulence factor interference with NPC
                  function, and the underlying mechanisms of nucleoporin
                  diseases at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC. [Figure: see

                  simulation and design is an important step in increasing the
                  accuracy of computational protein modeling. Recent analysis of
                  high-resolution crystal structures has suggested a new model,
                  termed backrub, to describe localized, hinge-like alternative
                  backbone and side-chain conformations observed in the crystal
                  lattice. The model involves internal backbone rotations about
                  axes between C-alpha atoms. Based on this observation, we have
                  implemented a backrub-inspired sampling method in the Rosetta
                  structure prediction and design program. We evaluate this
                  model of backbone flexibility using three different tests.
                  First, we show that Rosetta backrub simulations recapitulate
                  the correlation between backbone and side-chain conformations
                  in the high-resolution crystal structures upon which the model
                  was based. As a second test of backrub sampling, we show that
                  backbone flexibility improves the accuracy of predicting
                  point-mutant side-chain conformations over fixed backbone
                  rotameric sampling alone. Finally, we show that backrub
                  sampling of triosephosphate isomerase loop 6 can capture the
                  millisecond/microsecond oscillation between the open and
                  closed states observed in solution. Our results suggest that
                  backrub sampling captures a sizable fraction of localized
                  conformational changes that occur in natural proteins.
                  Application of this simple model of backbone motions may
                  significantly improve both protein design and atomistic
                  simulations of localized protein flexibility.},

                  development trajectories for eight anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike human
                  antibodies (Abs). To mimic the immunological process of BCR
                  selection during affinity maturation in germinal centers
                  (GCs), we performed deep mutational scanning on anti-S1
                  molecular Fabs using yeast display coupled to
                  fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Focusing only on changes
                  in affinity upon mutation, we found that human Ab development
                  pathways have few mutations which impart changes in monovalent
                  binding dissociation constants and that these mutations can
                  occur in nearly any order. Maturation pathways of two bnAbs
                  showed that while they are only slightly less permissible than
                  subtype-specific Abs, more development steps on average are
                  needed to reach the same level of affinity. Many of the
                  subtype-specific Abs had inherent affinity for antigen, and
                  these results were robust against different potential inferred
                  precursor sequences. To evaluate the effect of differential
                  affinity for precursors on GC outcomes, we adapted a
                  coarse-grained affinity maturation model. This model showed
                  that antibody precursors with minimal affinity advantages

                  design of ligand-binding transmembrane proteins by integrating
                  deep learning and energy-based methods. We designed

                  proteins (TMPs) have been crucial to various cellular
                  processes through their central role as gates and gatekeepers.
                  Despite their importance, experimental high-resolution
                  structures for TMPs remain underrepresented due to
                  experimental challenges. Given its performance leap, structure
                  predictions have begun to close the gap. However, identifying
                  the membrane regions and topology in three-dimensional
                  structure files on a large scale still requires additional in
                  silico predictions. Here, we introduce TMVisDB to sieve
                  through millions of predicted structures for TMPs. This
                  resource enables both browsing through 46 million predicted
                  TMPs and visualizing them along with their topological
                  annotations without having to tap into costly predictions of
                  the AlphaFold3-style. TMVisDB joins AlphaFoldDB structure
                  predictions and transmembrane topology predictions from the
                  protein language model (pLM) based method TMbed . We showcase
                  the utility of TMVisDB for the analysis of proteins through
                  two use cases, namely the B-lymphocyte antigen CD20 ( Homo
                  sapiens ) and the cellulose synthase ( Novosphingobium sp. P6W
                  ). We demonstrate the value of TMVisDB for large-scale

                  activities. Coarse-grained molecular models of intrinsically
                  disordered proteins have been developed to shed light on and
                  predict single-chain properties and phase separation. An RNA
                  model compatible with such models for disordered proteins
                  would enable the study of complex biomolecular mixtures
                  involving RNA. Here, we present a sequence-independent
                  coarse-grained, two-beads-per-nucleotide model of disordered,
                  flexible RNA based on a hydropathy scale. We parametrize the
                  model, which we term CALVADOS-RNA, using a combination of
                  bottom-up and top-down approaches to reproduce local RNA
                  geometry and intramolecular interactions based on atomistic
                  simulations and in vitro experiments. The model
                  semiquantitatively captures several aspects of RNA–RNA and
                  RNA–protein interactions. We examined RNA–RNA interactions by
                  comparing calculated and experimental virial coefficients and
                  nonspecific RNA–protein interaction by studying the reentrant
                  phase behavior of protein–RNA mixtures. We demonstrate the
                  utility of the model by simulating the formation of mixed
                  condensates consisting of the disordered region of MED1 and
                  RNA chains and the selective partitioning of disordered
                  regions from transcription factors into these and compare the
                  results to experiments. Despite the simplicity of our model,
                  we show that it captures several key aspects of protein–RNA
                  interactions and may therefore be used as a baseline model to
                  study several aspects of the biophysics and biology of

                  streaming services that are now central to the music
                  industries internationally. One important set of criticisms
                  concerns the amount of money that music creators receive for
                  the recorded music that is distributed on these services. Many
                  claim that music streaming has made it harder than before for
                  musicians to make a living from music. This article identifies
                  and discusses some significant problems of argument and
                  evidence surrounding these criticisms, as follows: (a) a
                  dubious focus on ‘per-stream’ rates offered by music streaming
                  services, (b) a failure to see streaming services as part of
                  wider systems of music and ownership, (c) tendencies towards
                  simplification when systemic problems are taken into account,
                  and (d) the limited evidence provided when commentators claim,
                  imply or assume that the system has become notably less just.
                  It then discusses debates concerning what might be done to
                  improve the system, especially whether ‘user-centric’ systems
                  of payment might be adopted, instead of the current ‘pro-rata’
                  system. The article suggests that more musicians rather than
                  fewer might now be able to earn money from recorded music than
                  in preceding recorded-music systems. But it also proposes that
                  the current system retains the striking inequalities and
                  generally poor working conditions that characterised its
                  predecessors, and that better debate requires greater
                  transparency about usage and payment on the part of streaming
                  services and music businesses.},

                  thereby function as inhibitors and regulatory elements.
                  Peptide fragments of larger proteins are particularly
                  attractive for achieving these functions due to their inherent
                  potential to form native-like binding interactions. Recently
                  developed experimental approaches allow for high-throughput
                  measurement of protein fragment inhibitory activity in living
                  cells. However, it has thus far not been possible to predict
                  de novo which of the many possible protein fragments bind to
                  protein targets, let alone act as inhibitors. We have
                  developed a computational method, FragFold, that employs
                  AlphaFold to predict protein fragment binding to full-length
                  proteins in a high-throughput manner. Applying FragFold to
                  thousands of fragments tiling across diverse proteins revealed
                  peaks of predicted binding along each protein sequence.
                  Comparisons with experimental measurements establish that our
                  approach is a sensitive predictor of fragment function:
                  Evaluating inhibitory fragments from known protein-protein
                  interaction interfaces, we find 87\% are predicted by FragFold
                  to bind in a native-like mode. Across full protein sequences,
                  68\% of FragFold-predicted binding peaks match experimentally
                  measured inhibitory peaks. Deep mutational scanning
                  experiments support the predicted binding modes and uncover
                  superior inhibitory peptides in high throughput. Further,
                  FragFold is able to predict previously unknown protein binding
                  modes, explaining prior genetic and biochemical data. The
                  success rate of FragFold demonstrates that this computational
                  approach should be broadly applicable for discovering
                  inhibitory protein fragments across proteomes.},

                  morphology tuning with a short introduction on nonporous
                  membranes. The two main strategies for pore formation in block

                  the manufacture of block copolymer membranes are considered,
                  including factors affecting the equilibrium morphology in
                  solid films, self-assembly of copolymer in solutions, and
                  macrophase separation by solvent–nonsolvent exchange.

                  prevention and treatment. Synthetic immunology can provide
                  such strategies by applying engineering principles from
                  synthetic biology to immunology. Synthetic biologists engineer
                  cells by top-down genetic manipulation or bottom-up assembly
                  from nanoscale building blocks. Recent successes in treating
                  advanced tumours and diseases using genetically engineered
                  immune cells highlight the power of the top-down synthetic
                  immunology approach. However, genetic immune engineering is
                  mostly limited to ex vivo applications and is subject to
                  complex counter-regulation inherent to immune functions.
                  Bottom-up synthetic biology can harness the rich
                  nanotechnology toolbox to engineer molecular and cellular
                  systems from scratch and equip them with desired functions.

                  tool for sensitive, selective and fast determination of

                  physical features that modulate cell signaling and protein
                  function. Lateral and transverse forces within the membrane
                  are significant and change rapidly as the membrane is bent or
                  stretched and as new constituents are added, removed or

                  differences in structure between the two leaflets of the

                  interact together with membrane deformation to alter the
                  activities of transmembrane channels and peripheral membrane
                  binding proteins. Here, we highlight some recent reports that
                  the physical properties of the membrane can help control the
                  function of transmembrane proteins and the motor-dependent

                  poorly understood. We determined cryogenic-electron microscopy
                  (cryo-EM) structures of each receptor to understand the

                  importance of every residue in GPR68 activation by generating
                  ∼9,500 mutants and measuring their effects on signaling and

                  technical complexity and workload. The inner transmembrane
                  region of MscS can bind lipid molecules, referred to as pore
                  lipids, offering an opportunity for fine-tuning channel
                  properties and improving sensing performance. We leveraged
                  lipid-like molecules, specifically detergents, to replace pore
                  lipids, introducing specific chemical groups into the MscS

                  challenging despite advances in deep learning. The design of
                  proteins that bind to small molecules has been particularly
                  difficult because it requires simultaneous optimization of
                  protein sequence, protein structure, and ligand conformation.
                  Despite their promise, current deep-learning algorithms have
                  struggled to navigate this landscape, precluding the zero- or
                  few-shot design of binders. Here we show that the combination
                  of two neural networks in an iterative design algorithm can
                  create small-molecule binding proteins from scratch with high
                  accuracy. To optimize a design in the joint distribution of
                  sequence, structure, and ligand conformation, we use a pair of
                  neural networks that were trained on reciprocal tasks. We
                  train and use a graph neural network, LASErMPNN, to design
                  protein sequence given protein-ligand co-structure, and we use
                  RoseTTAFold-All Atom (RFAA) to predict protein-ligand
                  co-structure given protein sequence. We iteratively apply
                  these two networks to design proteins that bind the drug,
                  exatecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor that is prone to
                  inactivation by hydrolysis9. Each of four experimentally
                  tested designs bound the drug, with the lowest dissociation
                  constant (Kd) near 100 nM. The hit rate and highest affinity
                  design each surpassed the current state-of-the-art method by
                  5- and 70-fold, respectively. We further show that LASErMPNN
                  can improve upon its own designs in a manner resembling
                  chain-of-thought reasoning. Without experimental input,
                  LASErMPNN suggested two mutations that increased affinity by
                  over two orders of magnitude (Kd = 1.2 +/- 0.2 nM). Designs
                  were selective, structurally accurate, and achieved their
                  intended purpose to protect the drug from hydrolysis. Our work
                  describes a recipe for using neural networks to automate the
                  design of high affinity small-molecule binding proteins, which
                  should have wide application in the creation of novel
                  drug-delivery vehicles, antidotes, sensors, and enzymes.}

                  excitable cells. In nature, ion channel function is customized
                  by modulatory proteins that have evolved to fulfill distinct
                  physiological needs. Yet, engineering synthetic modulators
                  that precisely tune ion channel function is challenging. One
                  example involves the voltage-gated sodium (Na V ) channel that
                  initiates the action potential, and whose dysfunction
                  amplifies late/persistent sodium current ( I NaL ), a
                  commonality that underlies various human diseases including
                  cardiac arrhythmias and epilepsy. Here, using a computational
                  protein design platform, we engineered a de novo peptide
                  modulator, ELIXIR, that binds Na V channels with submicromolar
                  affinity. Functional analysis revealed an unexpected
                  selectivity in inhibiting ‘pathogenic’ I NaL and confirmed its
                  effectiveness in reversing Na V dysfunction linked to both
                  cardiac arrhythmias and epilepsy in cellular and murine
                  models. These findings exemplify the efficacy of de novo
                  protein design for engineering synthetic ion channel
                  modulators and sets the stage for rational design of future

                  methods to predict the distribution of relative orientations
                  of two domains tethered by a flexible linker. The range of
                  interdomain distances and orientations (poses) of such
                  domain-linker-domain (D-L-D) proteins can play an important
                  role in protein function, allostery, aggregation, and the
                  thermodynamics of binding. The CASP16 Conformational Ensembles
                  Experiment included two challenges to predict the interdomain
                  pose distribution of a Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) D-L-D
                  construct, called ZLBT-C, in which two of SpA’s five nearly
                  identical domains are connected by either (1) a six-residue
                  wild-type (WT) linker (kadnkf), or (2) an all-glycine (Gly6)
                  linker. The wild-type linker has a highly conserved sequence
                  and is thought to contribute to the energetic barrier for
                  binding with host antibodies. Ground truth was provided by
                  nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) residual dipolar coupling
                  (RDC) data on WT protein and small angle X-ray scattering
                  (SAXS) data on both proteins in solution. Twenty-five
                  predictor groups submitted 35 sets of predicted conformational
                  distributions, in the form of population-weighted finite
                  ensembles of discrete structures. Unlike traditional CASP
                  assessments that compare predicted atomic models to
                  experimental atomic models, the accuracy of these predictions
                  was assessed by back-calculating NMR RDCs and SAXS curves from
                  each ensemble of atomic models and comparing these results to
                  respective experimental data. Accuracy was also assessed by
                  using kernelization to compare ensembles to the continuous
                  orientational distributions optimally fit to experimental
                  data. In our assessment, predictions spanned a wide range of
                  accuracy, but none were close fits to the combined NMR and
                  SAXS data. In addition, none were able to recapitulate the
                  observed difference between WT and Gly6 proteins, as observed
                  in the SAXS data. These results, and our analysis, highlighted
                  strengths and weaknesses, plus complementarity of NMR RDC and
                  SAXS analysis.Abstract Figure},

                  Factor Receptor (EGFR), a key drug target involved in cell
                  growth, differentiation, and cancer development.Over 1,800
                  designs were submitted across two rounds. Of these, 601
                  proteins were selected and characterized for expression and
                  binding affinity to EGFR, with competitors both optimizing
                  existing binders (KD= 1.21 nM) and creatingde novobinders (KD=
                  82 nM).All selected designs were experimentally validated
                  using Adaptyv’s automated Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI)

                  tools for designing proteins purpose-built to solve problems
                  in medicine, agriculture, and industrial processes. Recent
                  work has trained ever larger language models, but there has
                  been little systematic study of the optimal training
                  distributions and the influence of model scale on the
                  sequences generated by PLMs. We introduce the ProGen3 family
                  of sparse generative PLMs, and we develop compute-optimal
                  scaling laws to scale up to a 46B-parameter model pre-trained
                  on 1.5T amino acid tokens. ProGen3’s pre-training data is
                  sampled from an optimized data distribution over the Profluent
                  Protein Atlas v1, a carefully curated dataset of 3.4B
                  full-length proteins. We evaluate for the first time in the
                  wet lab the influence of model scale on the sequences
                  generated by PLMs, and we find that larger models generate
                  viable proteins for a much wider diversity of protein
                  families. Finally, we find both computationally and
                  experimentally that larger models are more responsive to
                  alignment with laboratory data, resulting in improved protein
                  fitness prediction and sequence generation capabilities. These
                  results indicate that larger PLMs like ProGen3-46B trained on
                  larger, well-curated datasets are powerful foundation models
                  that push the frontier of protein design.1},

                  actively maintained concentration gradients of lipids between
                  bilayer leaflets, termed lipid asymmetry. 1–3 Lipid asymmetry
                  has been linked to many cellular processes 4,5 , but the
                  mechanisms that connect lipid trans-bilayer concentration
                  gradients to cellular functions are poorly understood. Here we
                  systematically map the cellular processes affected by
                  dysregulation of lipid asymmetry by knocking out flippases,
                  floppases, and scramblases in mammalian cells. We identify
                  broad alterations to core metabolic pathways including
                  nutrient uptake, neutral lipid turnover, pentose phosphate
                  pathway and glycolysis. Lipidomics, respirometry, lipid and
                  metabolic imaging, and live-cell calorimetry revealed elevated
                  neutral lipid and ATP consumption rates which are coupled with
                  increased heat loss per unit of biomass synthesized despite
                  slower growth. This suggests that compensatory maintenance of
                  lipid asymmetry strains the cellular energy budget, inducing a
                  shift from a growth-promoting anabolic to a more energy-using
                  catabolic state. Our data indicate that lipid asymmetry and
                  its active maintenance is key for proper cell energetics,
                  highlighting its putative role as a cellular store of
                  potential energy akin to proton and ion transmembrane

                  using nanopore biosensors is critical for disease diagnosis
                  and other biomedical applications. Processing large, complex
                  single-channel translocation data streams poses a significant
                  challenge for peptide analyte classification. Here, we present
                  a supervised deep learning data processing pipeline for
                  peptide classification from translocation events. The first
                  stage employs a convolutional and recurrent neural network,
                  adapted from the Deep-Channel multi-channel classifier, to
                  accurately classify raw current recordings into discrete
                  conductance states, including partially blocked
                  sub-conductance intermediates. The second stage, peptide
                  classification, utilizes a novel branched input network with a
                  temporal convolutional network for processing translocation
                  event conductance state sequences and a dense network for
                  incorporating computed event-level and global kinetic
                  features. Using idealized simulated multi-state translocation
                  data for seven peptides, we demonstrate high classification
                  accuracy (0.99) when global features are included alongside
                  event-level features. For classifying mixture samples, where
                  only event-level features are applicable, performance is more
                  modest (0.68 accuracy). Peptide mixture predictions showed
                  reasonable accuracy (MAE 0.045-0.161), although
                  misclassification resulted in false positives. Event
                  stochasticity and the fact that some peptides possessed
                  similar kinetic parameters posed challenging for event-level
                  prediction. However, vote aggregation from translocation event
                  streams achieves perfect 100\% accuracy, when predicting pure
                  peptide samples. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates a
                  robust deep learning framework for nanopore peptide
                  classification using simulated data, laying the groundwork for
                  classifying peptides from complex mixtures using real
                  experimental data with the anthrax toxin protective antigen

                  for the effective clearance of Food and Drug
                  Administration-approved drugs in healthy mice. As a proof of
                  concept, we designed proteins that bind to the anticoagulant
                  apixaban. Since apixaban lacks chirality, we used mirror-image
                  synthesis and cyclization to enhance the designed protein's in
                  vivo stability. Both protein variants demonstrated effective
                  activity, facilitating the rapid clearance of apixaban within

                  we extended our analysis to a de novo-designed protein

                  used as antidotes in vivo, and that computational tools can be

                  on the rates of amino acid substitutions. More recently, with
                  the availability of sequence data and advanced experimental
                  techniques, the focus of attention has shifted toward the

                  been made in the apparent absence of any awareness of the

                  for decades. The numerical indices being promoted suffer from
                  numerous conceptual and quantitative problems, to the point of
                  being devoid of meaning, with the authors even failing to

                  Moreover, the promulgators of these new laws base their

  abstract     = {Events and festivals are key elements of the tourism product
                  in many destinations (Getz and Page, 2016). The ability of
                  festivals and events to attract visitors to a host region, and
                  to contribute to its economic and social well-being explains
                  the significance afforded to them in many tourism policies and
                  strategies (Mair and Whitford, 2013). This contribution is a
                  strong justification for public funding of events and
                  festivals (Felsenstein and Fleischer, 2003; O’Hagan, 1992).
                  Thus, in conjunction with tourism, they are becoming a
                  realistic policy option for regional development (Moscardo,
                  2007; Robinson et al., 2004). However, the rapid growth of the
                  events/festival industry in the past few decades has not
                  always been matched with the level of research devoted to
                  investigating it. Additionally, the fragmented nature of the
                  research that exists poses challenges for researchers and
                  practitioners trying to identify both the existing knowledge
                  and any research gaps. Nonetheless, the interest of the
                  academic community in event and festival research has
                  increased significantly, particularly in the past decade. This
                  has broadly aligned with the time that the International
                  Journal of Event and Festival Management has been in
                  existence. Here we look back on the general direction of
                  research in our field and provide some potential avenues for
                  future research to strengthen and enrich event and festival
                  research.To date, several reviews have examined the state of
                  research relating to festivals and events. Getz (2010)
                  reviewed the literature on festivals, identifying three major
                  discourses – a classical discourse, concerning the roles,
                  meanings and impacts of festivals in society and culture; an
                  instrumentalist discourse, where festivals are viewed as tools
                  to be used in economic development, particularly in relation
                  to tourism and place marketing; and an event management
                  discourse, which focuses on the production and marketing of
                  festivals and the management of festival organisations (Getz,
                  2010). Getz and Page (2016) also reviewed the event tourism
                  literature. According to Getz (2013), there are five core
                  propositions of event tourism: events can attract visitors who
                  may not otherwise visit the area; events can create a positive
                  destination image and branding; events contribute to place
                  marketing by making destinations more attractive; events
                  animate cities, resorts and parks; and event tourism is a
                  catalyst for other forms of development. A more recent review
                  of trends in event management research was published in 2017,
                  highlighting the themes which appeared to represent the most
                  popular research topics over the period from 1998 until 2013
                  in studies published in leading hospitality and tourism as
                  well as event-focused academic journals (Park and Park, 2017).
                  A total of 698 articles were analysed and results showed that
                  the most popular research topics were marketing, events and
                  destinations and management. Planning and evaluation of events
                  along with the use of technology in events were also well
                  represented in this sample. However, events education and
                  human resources in events appeared to be less well researched
                  (Park and Park, 2017). Other reviews have been completed in
                  the area of festivals, but they have been limited by a focus
                  on papers published in journals associated with one discipline
                  or field of study only. For example, Cudny (2014) took a
                  geographical perspective and Frost (2015) reviewed
                  anthropological studies of festivals, which broadly position
                  festivals as sites of cultural practice and experience.
                  However, neither addressed festival management issues.The
                  literature on events and festivals has been approached from a
                  number of theoretical perspectives. Initially, cultural and
                  social research predominated. However, more recently far more
                  research has taken a business orientation, focusing on themes
                  such as management, marketing and tourism, as noted by Park
                  and Park (2017).The links between events (particularly
                  festivals) and tourism have been a fertile area for research.
                  Increasing tourism is one of the key reasons why local
                  governments support and stage festivals (Mayfield and
                  Crompton, 1995), and according to Anderssen and Getz (2009),
                  many destinations view festivals as attractions and use them
                  as part of their destination marketing strategy. There are
                  clear benefits to hosting festivals, primarily in terms of
                  economic but also social benefits. In relation to economic
                  benefits, increasing visitor numbers, supporting job creation
                  and underpinning economic development appear to be the main
                  positive impacts of festivals; however, the extent of such
                  positive impacts is disputed in relation to whether festivals
                  actually attract visitors (McKercher et al., 2006); whether
                  visitors are even aware of festivals when they make their
                  destination decision (Oh and Lee, 2012); and whether festival
                  visitors, many of whom camp and eat on the festival site, are
                  actually making much economic contribution at all (Saleh and
                  Ryan, 2003). Further, in relation to social benefits such as
                  community cohesion, sense of place, belonging and identity,
                  the literature appears somewhat contrary. While there is
                  plenty of evidence to suggest that these are the objectives of
                  festival organisers, funding bodies and local authorities,
                  there appears to be less evidence of whether festivals are
                  successful in achieving these objectives, and through which
                  mechanisms this may be facilitated. Further, while festivals
                  have unique features and cultural dimensions which are also
                  important factors for attracting tourists, the importance of
                  exercising caution when using tangible or intangible historic
                  and cultural resources for festival activities seems to be
                  less acknowledged. Therefore, while the potential benefits of
                  festivals have been clearly outlined, research appears to be
                  lacking in terms of truly comprehending how best to achieve
                  these desired benefits.There is also a significant body of
                  work that examines events/festivals and marketing, with this
                  topic representing the most widely researched theme identified
                  by Park and Park (2017). Drawing on initial work by Crompton
                  and McKay (1997), who proposed six key motivational dimensions
                  to explain festival attendance, researchers have examined
                  attendance motivations in a multitude of contexts, yet for the
                  most part, few significant differences have been found.
                  Existing reviews have already ascertained that attendance
                  motivations have been thoroughly researched (Getz, 2010); yet,
                  studies continue to be published in this topic. For example,
                  while there have been some minor differences to the original
                  Crompton and McKay (1997) motivation framework, the underlying
                  dimensions appear to be relatively stable over time and across
                  a variety of contexts. Nonetheless, each year more studies
                  appear testing these dimensions in yet more
                  contexts.Similarly, an established body of research has
                  concluded that good quality festivals result in attendee
                  satisfaction, which then leads to increased loyalty in the
                  form of future re-purchase intentions (see for example, Anil,
                  2012; Cole and Illum, 2006; Cole and Chancellor, 2009; Lee et
                  al., 2007; Son and Lee, 2011; Mason and Nassivera, 2013).
                  Nevertheless, despite this literature, studies examining the
                  relationship between satisfaction, quality and loyalty
                  continue to be published. Finally, market segmentation studies
                  occur frequently in the festival literature, yet as most are
                  case study based, they are failing to make generalisable
                  contributions to our knowledge of this area. In summary, it
                  appears that in these areas, researchers have simply been
                  making only small, incremental contributions.Several issues
                  have arisen in relation to festival marketing and consumer
                  behaviour which would present useful opportunities for further
                  study. For example, the decision-making process of festival
                  goers requires more research, as much of this research to date
                  has been undertaken in case study contexts, without further
                  generalisation (e.g. Kruger and Saayman, 2012). Further, there
                  is a noticeable lack of research in areas of marketing that
                  more recently gained greater popularity, including
                  experiential marketing, and very little research on the role
                  of social media and events. Experiential marketing focuses
                  primarily on helping consumers to experience a brand, with the
                  goal of forming a memorable connection and an expected outcome
                  of future purchases and brand loyalty. Festivals offer an
                  unrivalled opportunity for organisations to showcase their
                  brands and build a connection in the mind of the consumer
                  between the festival experience and the brand experience, as
                  noted by Chen et al. (2011), yet this is a relatively
                  unexplored area where future research should be carried
                  out.Social media has also been the focus of surprisingly few
                  festival studies thus far. This is particularly unexpected
                  given the widespread use of various types of social media and
                  its obvious links with marketing. In a case study of music
                  festivals, Hudson and Hudson (2013) carried out some
                  pioneering work to understand how festival organisers are
                  engaging with both social media and their consumers. Their
                  findings suggest that music festival organisers are proactive
                  in using social media. In a subsequent study, Hudson et al.
                  (2015) developed a conceptual model that was subsequently
                  tested with music festival attendees. Study findings provided
                  evidence that social media do indeed have a significant
                  influence on emotions and attachments to festival brands, and
                  that social media-based relationships lead to desired outcomes
                  such as positive word of mouth. Montanari et al. (2013)
                  examine an Italian photography festival, and revealed how
                  using social media and Web 2.0 technology enhanced the way the
                  festival was able to communicate with its audience. Social
                  media is also changing the way potential attendees make their
                  attendance decision. Lee et al. (2012) investigated whether
                  engagement with a festival “event” page on Facebook was linked
                  with actual attendance at the festival. They found some
                  evidence to suggest that the event Facebook page stimulated
                  emotions and a desire to attend the actual festival. Research
                  by Williams et al. (2015) suggests that festivals are both
                  generators and animators of electronic word of mouth, but the
                  authors acknowledge the exploratory nature of their research.
                  Sigala (2018a, b) has advanced our conceptual knowledge of
                  social media as it relates to both festival management and
                  marketing, creating a typology of the way that social media is
                  being used in festival management and organisation. She also
                  drew attention to the use and influence of social media on
                  both attendee experiences and decision making and festival
                  marketing strategies. In view of the omnipresent nature of
                  social media, this is an area where there is a considerable
                  need for further research in the festival context; there is
                  ample room for new studies relating to social media to bring
                  theory development and practical implications.Technology
                  mediated experiences are changing the festivalscape as events
                  and festivals integrate hardware, software, netware and
                  humanware into the attendee experience (Neuhofer et al., 2014;
                  Robertson et al., 2015; Van Winkle et al., 2018). ICT has been
                  used at events and festivals for utilitarian and hedonic
                  purposes yet little is known about the implications for the
                  events, attendees, volunteers and other stakeholders. Thus,
                  research into the integration of ICT into the administration,
                  design, marketing, operations and risk management of events
                  and festivals is essential. An upcoming special issue of IJEFM
                  will focus on these key issues.Three key aspects of strategic
                  festival management have received significant attention from
                  researchers – stakeholder management; festival success factors
                  and conversely, festival failures; and festivals and
                  environmental sustainability. The importance of understanding
                  and managing stakeholders is widely acknowledged (e.g. Reid,
                  2007), and it may very well be that further research will
                  simply underline this. However, in relation to other aspects
                  of management, there are certainly areas where more research
                  is required. For example, whilst knowledge transfer appears to
                  be taking place in successful festivals (Stadler et al.,
                  2014), transfer of knowledge is not well defined, or even
                  explicitly acknowledged. Interestingly, festival failure has
                  apparently been the subject of more research than festival
                  success but further areas for useful contributions remain.
                  These include succession planning and risk management. In
                  addition, differences in strategic management planning and
                  operations between festivals under different types of
                  ownership appear significantly under-researched (Andersson and
                  Getz, 2009; Carlsen and Andersson 2011). Despite a few studies
                  (e.g. Robertson and Yeoman, 2014; Yeoman, 2013), there have
                  also been few attempts to foresee future trends and issues
                  that are likely to affect festivals and their management.Getz
                  and Page (2016) also argue for further research to better
                  understand the role that festivals play in bringing together
                  disparate groups such as visitors and residents. Complex
                  relationships between communal identity and place emerge as
                  people have various sets of connections to multiple notions of
                  “place” and “home”. This is an area where social science
                  research could play an important role, bringing together the
                  business aspects of tourism and festival management with the
                  issues of place, space and people researched by geographers
                  and social scientists.There is also a small but growing body
                  of knowledge on festivals and sustainability; however, this
                  topical area offers considerable potential for future
                  research, and ample room for further theoretical and practical
                  contributions. Research attention may be placed on issues such
                  as the triple bottom line, links between festivals and social
                  sustainability, and even the opportunities for festivals to
                  play an education and behaviour change role in relation to
                  pro-environmental behaviour. For example, Andersson and
                  Lundberg (2013) considered the notion of commensurability and
                  proposed a framework for assessing the overall TBL
                  sustainability of a festival by allocating a monetary value to
                  each component. This is done using market values of emission
                  rights, the shadow costs of environmental resources,
                  contingent valuation analysis of (willingness to pay for)
                  socio-cultural impacts and estimates of direct expenditure and
                  opportunity cost. However, the authors acknowledge that there
                  are aspects of their framework which are subjective, and they
                  note that future research is needed to clarify the
                  generalisability of their framework. Duran et al. (2014) also
                  propose a framework – the Sustainable Festival Management
                  Model – which highlights that stakeholder participation,
                  especially non-governmental organisations, the tourism sector
                  and local people who might be impacted by the festival, is
                  vital for the development of a sustainable festival. Van
                  Niekerk and Coetzee (2011) used the VICE model (visitor,
                  industry community and environment) to assess the
                  sustainability of an arts festival in South Africa and suggest
                  that this framework can help to identify critical issues
                  relating to a festival and its sustainability. However, they
                  also note that research using this model is somewhat limited
                  in the events context and that further research on the
                  efficacy and usefulness of the model is required (Van Niekerk
                  and Coetzee, 2011).There are several implications for future
                  festival/event research resulting from the brief overview
                  provided. These can be classified as opportunities for
                  interdisciplinary research, a reliance on the western
                  perspective and a corresponding lack of different cultural
                  perspectives, an absence of research into the pedagogy of
                  festival/event studies and finally, an array of limitations
                  associated with the current body of knowledge.First, there is
                  a lack of interdisciplinary work that incorporates business
                  and social and/or spatial perspectives. In his review, Getz
                  (2010) highlighted that the classical discourse was
                  under-acknowledged in extant festival studies, and that more
                  connections should be made between festival studies and other
                  disciplines such as sociology and anthropology. Further, Cudny
                  (2014) called for more theoretical research to underpin the
                  development of festival studies in future. Much of the work
                  that has taken a business perspective, perhaps not
                  surprisingly, has focused inwards on the festival – how to
                  market, manage, stage it and provide a good quality service
                  and experience (see Park and Park, 2017). However, very little
                  of the festival research appearing in the business literature
                  has been outwardly focused – considering how festivals may be
                  mechanisms for achieving other aims – social, cultural,
                  political, behavioural, etc. Clearly, in order to survive,
                  festivals have to be successful business products, but in
                  order to achieve other objectives, managers need to be aware
                  of some of the issues that are explored in the social sciences
                  and humanities literature, such as inclusion vs exclusion at
                  festivals, festivals and authenticity/tradition, and festivals
                  as spaces of protest, counterculture and self-expression, to
                  name but a few. Interdisciplinary work, using theories and
                  concepts from beyond business disciplines (e.g. social
                  capital, affect and emotion theories and Florida’s (2002,
                  2003) creative industries framework) would inform festival
                  research, and while the majority of recent work being
                  published on festivals has appeared in journals associated
                  with tourism, events and business more broadly, applying other
                  disciplinary theories and frameworks would bring these to a
                  new audience and thus, help to make a greater
                  contribution.Second, there is a dearth of different cultural
                  perspectives in festival and event research. While already
                  highlighted by Getz (2010), it appears that researchers have
                  not paid much heed to his call for comparative and
                  cross-cultural studies. There is a need to move away from
                  Western paradigms when examining non-Western phenomena. For
                  example, Pine (2002) suggested that the development policy of
                  hotel groups or chains established in China needs to consider
                  the Chinese socio-economic context, thus implying that a
                  research model should be developed specifically for China
                  hotel development. China’s hotel industry is different from
                  that of other countries due to fierce competition, multiform
                  ownership and management systems, and coupled with China’s
                  unique culture society might require a different research
                  approach. Similar considerations would be of value in relation
                  to festivals research in other non-western contexts. In a
                  similar vein, the number of countries with resident
                  populations that are culturally diverse has led to an
                  awareness of the importance of building well-organised,
                  multicultural societies (Chin, 1992; Lee et al., 2012; Parekh,
                  2006). Festivals can play a significant role in this.
                  Multicultural festivals are especially important for minority
                  groups seeking to maintain cultural traditions (Lee et al.,
                  2012). However, despite some initial research in this area,
                  further detailed study of the nature of festivals in a
                  multicultural society would be of tremendous value.Third,
                  there are no pedagogical articles specifically related to
                  festival studies. There is a relatively limited body of
                  knowledge relating to teaching event management. For example
                  Getz (2010) highlights that events students should learn and
                  be able to apply both event specific knowledge (such as
                  understanding the meaning, importance and impacts of festivals
                  and events, and in addition their limited duration and
                  episodic nature) as well as management specific knowledge
                  including marketing, finance and accounting. Additionally,
                  initiatives such as the development of the International Event
                  Management Body of Knowledge seek to define research and
                  understand the parameters of events and the knowledge,
                  understanding and skills required in order to succeed in a
                  contemporary environment (Silvers et al., 2005). Nonetheless,
                  the pedagogy of festival and event studies remains an
                  important, yet significantly under-researched area.Finally,
                  there are a number of limitations relating to the existing
                  body of festival/event literature. Reminiscent of other review
                  papers in the broader tourism and hospitality context, and
                  beyond (e.g. Denizci Guillet and Mohammed, 2015; Kong and
                  Cheung, 2009; Mattila, 2004; Yoo and Weber, 2005), the vast
                  majority of papers relating to festival/event research are
                  empirical rather than conceptual and theoretical in nature. In
                  addition, as has been noted already, much of the research in
                  the field of festivals has taken a case study approach. This
                  has arguably limited the scope and scale of our knowledge of
                  festivals. More sophisticated methods, both qualitative and
                  quantitative, would provide a more nuanced study of particular
                  festivals and places, yet at the same time contribute further
                  to advancing our theoretical and practical knowledge of
                  festivals.Given this, a call for greater theory development
                  and testing within the festival context appears timely. This
                  is in line with Oh et al. (2004, p. 441) who note that “[…]
                  applications are not a wrong effort to make; what is needed is
                  a stronger conceptual rigour and meaningful contribution [to]
                  back to the mainstream theoretical thought through creative
                  application and domain-specific theory development
                  activities.”Judith Mair and Karin Weber},

                  participant observation with six festival photographers I show
                  that symbolic and social boundaries are employed in three
                  areas: (1) boundaries in festival format (i.e. [partially]
                  free or ticketed), (2) boundaries in distribution partners and
                  technologies and (3) boundaries in promotional

                  intentionally used by festival organisers to build and
                  delineate festival audiences. Implications are drawn on
                  current understandings of the accessibility of music festival
                  spaces, arguing that festival research should move beyond

                  music festivals are often marketed as celebratory spaces that
                  are “welcoming to everyone”, few studies have investigated
                  diversity and inclusion nor marketing and promotion practices
                  at music festivals. This study shows how festival audiences

                  single global archive for three-dimensional (3D)
                  macromolecular structure data. Current PDB holdings exceed
                  230,000 experimentally determined structures of proteins,

                  represents a significant open challenge in structural biology.
                  Increasingly many methods have been reported for perturbing
                  and sampling AlphaFold2 (AF2) [1] to achieve multiple
                  conformational states. However, if multiple methods achieve
                  similar results, that does not in itself invalidate any
                  method, nor does it answer why these methods work.
                  Interpreting why deep learning models give the results they do
                  is a critically important endeavor for future model
                  development and appropriate usage. To help the field continue
                  to try to answer these questions, this work addresses
                  misunderstandings and inaccurate conclusions in refs. [2-6].
                  Deep learning methods development moves quickly, and by no
                  means did we think that the implementation of AF-Cluster in
                  [7] would be the final word on how to sample multiple
                  conformations. However, Porter et al.'s primary critique, that
                  AF-Cluster does not use local evolutionary couplings in its
                  MSA clusters, is incorrect. We report here further analysis
                  that underscores our original finding that local evolutionary
                  couplings do indeed play an important role in AF-Cluster
                  predictions, and refute all false claims made against [7].},

                  patterns or stereospecific selection filters. However, the
                  construction of heteromeric pore-forming proteins for
                  single-molecule sensing is challenging due to the
                  uncontrollability of producing position isomers and
                  difficulties in purification of regio-defined products. To
                  overcome these preparation obstacles, we present an in situ
                  strategy involving single-molecule chemical modification of a
                  heptameric pore-forming protein to build a stereo- and
                  regio-specific heteromeric nanopore (hetero-nanopore) with a
                  subunit stoichiometric ratio of 3:4. The steric hindrance
                  inherent in the homo-nanopore of K238C aerolysin directs the
                  stereo- and regio-selective modification of maleimide
                  derivatives. Our method utilizes real-time ionic current
                  recording to facilitate controlled voltage manipulation for
                  stoichiometric modification and position-based side-isomer
                  removal. Single-molecule experiments and all-atom molecular
                  dynamics simulations revealed that the hetero-nanopore
                  features an asymmetric stereo- and regio-defined residue
                  structure. The hetero-nanopore produced was characterized by
                  mass spectrometry and single-particle cryogenic electron
                  microscopy. In a proof-of-concept single-molecule sensing
                  experiment, the hetero-nanopore exhibited 95\% accuracy for
                  label-free discrimination of four peptide stereoisomers with
                  single-amino-acid structural and chiral differences in the
                  mixtures. The customized hetero-nanopores could advance

                  predominantly on studies of small (<150 aa) proteins that
                  refold reversibly from a chemically denatured state. However,
                  as protein length increases so does the competition between
                  off-pathway misfolding and on-pathway folding, creating a more
                  complex energy landscape ("folding funnel"). Little is known
                  about how intermediates populated during the folding of larger
                  proteins affect navigation of this more complex landscape.
                  Previously, we reported extremely slow folding rates for the
                  539 aa β-helical passenger domain of pertactin (P.69T),
                  including conditions that favor the formation of a kinetically
                  trapped, off-pathway partially folded state (PFS). Existence
                  of an on-pathway intermediate for P.69T folding was speculated
                  but its characterization remained elusive. In this work, we
                  exploited the extremely slow kinetics of PFS unfolding to
                  develop a double-jump "denaturant challenge" assay. With this
                  assay, we identified a transient unfolding intermediate, PFS*,
                  that adopts a similar structure to PFS, including C-terminal
                  folded structure and a disordered N terminus, yet unfolds much
                  more quickly than PFS. Additional experiments revealed that
                  PFS* also functions as an on-pathway intermediate for P.69T
                  folding. Collectively, these results support a C-to-N-terminal
                  model for P.69T folding, with folding initiated in the
                  C-terminus with the rate-limiting formation of the transient
                  on-pathway PFS* intermediate, which sits at the junction of
                  the kinetic competition between folding and misfolding.
                  Notably, processive folding from C-to-N terminus also occurs
                  during C-to-N-terminal translocation of P.69T across the
                  bacterial outer membrane. These results illuminate the crucial
                  role of kinetics when navigating a complex energy landscape
                  for protein folding.},

                  Current methods for visualizing lipid localization do not meet

                  neuronal genome architecture1-3, constitute a biochemical
                  enigma. This is because regulatory DNA elements make selective
                  and stable contacts with DNA sequences located hundreds of
                  kilobases away, instead of interacting with proximal sequences
                  occupied by the exact same transcription factors1,4. This is
                  exemplified in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), in which only
                  a fraction of LHX2-, EBF1- and LDB1-bound sites interact with
                  each other, converging into highly selective multi-chromosomal
                  enhancer hubs5. To obtain biochemical insight into this
                  process, here we assembled olfactory receptor (OR) enhancer
                  hubs in vitro with recombinant proteins and enhancer DNA.
                  Cell-free reconstitution of enhancer hubs revealed that OR
                  enhancers form nucleoprotein condensates with unusual,
                  solid-like characteristics. Assembly of these solid
                  condensates is orchestrated by specific DNA motifs enriched in
                  OR enhancers, which are likely to confer distinct homotypic
                  properties on their resident LHX2-EBF1-LDB1 complexes.
                  Single-molecule tracking and pulse-chase experiments in vivo
                  confirmed that LHX2 and EBF1 assemble
                  OR-transcription-competent condensates with solid properties
                  in OSN nuclei, under physiological concentrations of protein.
                  Thus, homophilic nucleoprotein interactions that are

                  Biophysical characterization showed that 17 (38\%) of 45
                  tested LUCS designs encompassing two different structural
                  topologies were well folded, including 16 with designed

                  generally detergent-solubilized, and there remains a need for
                  Nb development methods against membrane proteins in a
                  native-like membrane environment. To address this need, we
                  present a protocol for Nb selection via extraction of membrane
                  proteins into amphiphilic polymers such as styrene-maleic acid
                  to produce purified membrane proteins in stable
                  liponanoparticles. Proof of generality is demonstrated by
                  applying the pipeline to four membrane-resident enzymes of
                  differing fold, oligomerization state, and membrane topology
                  (reentrant membrane helix, transmembrane,

                  selectivity towards their target proteins with K D apparent
                  values ranging from 15 nM to 200 nM, depending on the
                  Nb-protein conjugate. In accordance with their tight binding,
                  various Nb-protein complexes were found to be stable to
                  size-exclusion chromatography purification. The Nbs were also
                  amenable to sortase-mediated ligation, enabling their
                  conversion into molecular probes for the target membrane
                  protein. The ability to select for such high-affinity Nb
                  against membrane proteins in SMALP will facilitate their

                  developments in the physics of jamming in particulate systems
                  can shed light on the packing of protein cores. Here, we
                  extend the framework of jamming to describe core packing in
                  collapsed polymers, as well as in all-atom models of folded
                  proteins. First, we show in a spherical bead-spring polymer
                  model (with and without bond-angle constraints) that as the
                  hydrophobic interactions increase relative to thermal
                  fluctuations, a jamming-like transition occurs when the core
                  packing fraction exceeds ϕc with the same power-law scaling
                  behavior for the potential energy Vr, excess contact number
                  ΔN, and characteristic frequency of the vibrational density of
                  states ω* versus Δϕ=ϕ−ϕc as that for jammed particulate
                  systems. Then, we develop an all-atom model for proteins and
                  find that, above ϕc∼0.55, protein cores undergo a jamming-like
                  transition, but with anomalous power-law scaling for Vr, ΔN,
                  and ω* versus Δϕ. The all-atom protein model remains close to
                  the native protein structure during jamming and accurately

                  bound to biological membranes, is an important property that
                  can influence molecular height, mobility, and accessibility.
                  However, quantifying the flexibility of surface-tethered
                  biomolecules in aqueous environments has been difficult due to
                  a lack of experimental tools. Here we introduce SurFlex
                  microscopy, a method based on fluorescence anisotropy that
                  exploits the relationship between the conformational dynamics
                  of a tethered molecule and the rotational diffusion of an
                  attached fluorophore to extract information about molecular
                  flexibility. By analyzing the polarization state of photons
                  emitted after polarized excitation, we quantify apparent
                  molecular flexibilities that include effects of tethering,
                  self-interactions and buffer conditions. We first demonstrate
                  the capabilities of SurFlex microscopy by measuring the
                  flexibility of bilayer-tethered single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) of
                  different lengths and nucleotide sequences. We find that
                  sequence significantly impacts ssDNA flexibility, consistent
                  with theoretical estimates, with weak intramolecular
                  interactions in random sequences leading to higher apparent
                  stiffness. Interestingly, we show that a pathological DNA
                  sequence linked to Huntington’s disease exhibits unusual
                  flexibility despite intramolecular interactions. We next
                  extend SurFlex microscopy to live cells by measuring surface
                  glycoprotein flexibility on red blood cells using fluorescent
                  lectins. We show that trypsinization decreases glycan
                  fluctuations, demonstrating that modifications to the cell
                  surface can alter the flexibility of remaining surface
                  molecules. SurFlex microscopy provides a new tool for
                  quantifying molecular flexibility that can be used to study
                  the role of tethered surface molecules in fundamental
                  biological processes.Significance statementBiomolecules
                  immobilized on one end play crucial roles in diverse cellular
                  processes, from cell-cell signaling through surface receptors
                  to the formation of DNA secondary structures. However,
                  measuring biomolecular flexibility on surfaces has remained
                  challenging. Here we present SurFlex microscopy, a technique
                  that uses fluorescence anisotropy to quantify the flexibility
                  of surface-anchored molecules. By analyzing the rotational
                  dynamics of fluorophores attached to the ends of fluctuating
                  biomolecules, SurFlex microscopy can be used to quantify
                  persistence length. We demonstrate its capabilities by
                  measuring sequence-dependent flexibility of DNA and
                  crowding-dependent changes in glycan flexibility on native

                  optimisation problems. These include unidentifiable parame-
                  ters, noisy data, unobserved states, and a combination of both
                  fast and slow timescales. This can make it difficult to choose
                  a suitable optimisation routinea priori. Nevertheless, many
                  attempts have been made to design optimisation routines
                  specifically for ion channel models, however, little work has
                  been done to compare these optimisation approaches. We have
                  developed ionBench, an open-source optimisation bench- marking
                  framework, to evaluate and compare these approaches against a
                  standard set of ion channel optimisation problems. We included
                  implementations of thirty-four unique optimisation approaches
                  that have been previously applied to ion channel models and
                  evaluated them against the ionBench test suite, consisting of
                  five parameter optimisation problems derived from the cardiac
                  ion channel literature. Each optimisation approach was
                  initiated from multiple starting parameters and tasked with
                  reproducing a problem-specific simulated dataset. Through
                  ionBench, we tracked and evaluated the performance of these
                  optimisations, identifying the expected run time until a
                  successful optimisation for each approach, which was used for
                  comparisons. Finally, we used these results, in addition to
                  other literature results, to identify a new efficient
                  approach. Its use could reduce computation time by multiple
                  orders of magnitude, while also improving the reliability of

                  challenge of de novo membrane protein (MP) and the design of
                  complex β-sheet folds. We performed a comprehensive benchmark
                  of one DL protein sequence design method, ProteinMPNN, using
                  transmembrane and water-soluble β-barrel folds as a model, and
                  compared the performance of ProteinMPNN to the new
                  membrane-specific Rosetta Franklin2023 energy function. We
                  tested the effect of input backbone refinement on ProteinMPNN
                  performance and found that given refined and well-defined
                  inputs, ProteinMPNN more accurately captures global sequence
                  properties despite complex folding biophysics. It generates
                  more diverse TMB sequences than Franklin2023 in pore-facing

                  that passed state-of-the-art in silico filters for
                  experimental validation, suggesting that the model could be
                  used in de novo design tasks of diverse nanopores for
                  single-molecule sensing and sequencing. Lastly, our results
                  indicate that the low success rate of ProteinMPNN for the

                  from different groups of humans and animals, the emissions of

                  by using a level III fugacity multimedia model. The results
                  showed that higher emission densities for the steroids were

                  This distribution was found to be generally similar to the

                  which more than 80\% was discharged into the water

                  been attributed to the presence of estrogenic substances such
                  as natural estrogens [estrone or 17beta-estradiol (E2)], the
                  synthetic estrogen used in birth-control pills [17

                  vitellogenin mRNA and protein, impacts on gonadal development
                  as evidenced by intersex in males and altered oogenesis in

                  coli, affects virulence, adhesion, and bacterial OM integrity.
                  However, despite more than 50 y of research, the molecular
                  basis for the role of OmpA has remained elusive. In this
                  study, we demonstrate that OmpA organizes the OM protein
                  lattice and mechanically connects it to the cell wall (CW).
                  Using gene fusions, atomic force microscopy, simulations, and
                  microfluidics, we show that the β-barrel domain of OmpA is
                  critical for maintaining the permeability barrier, but both
                  the β-barrel and CW-binding domains are necessary to enhance
                  the cell envelope's strength. OmpA integrates the compressive
                  properties of the OM protein lattice with the tensile strength
                  of the CW, forming a mechanically robust composite that
                  increases overall integrity. This coupling likely underpins
                  the ability of the entire envelope to function as a cohesive,

                  characterization difficult. Here we describe a general deep

                  membrane proteins while preserving their sequence, fold, and
                  function using genetically encoded de novo protein WRAPs
                  (Water-soluble RFdiffused Amphipathic Proteins) that surround
                  the lipid-interacting hydrophobic surfaces, rendering them
                  stable and water-soluble without the need for detergents. We
                  design WRAPs for both beta-barrel outer membrane and helical
                  multi-pass transmembrane proteins, and show that the
                  solubilized proteins retain the binding and enzymatic

                  syphilis vaccine antigens. A 4.0 angstrom cryo-EM map of
                  WRAPed TP0698 is closely consistent with the design model.
                  WRAPs should be broadly useful for facilitating biochemical

                  binders, designing proteins that bind with high affinity to
                  polar protein targets remains an outstanding problem. Here we
                  show that RFdiffusion can be conditioned to efficiently
                  generate protein scaffolds that form geometrically matched
                  extended beta-sheets with target protein edge beta-strands in
                  which polar groups on the target are nearly perfectly
                  complemented with hydrogen bonding groups on the design. We
                  use this approach to design binders against a set of
                  therapeutically relevant polar targets (KIT, PDGFRɑ, ALK-2,
                  ALK-3, FCRL5, and NRP1) and find that beta-strand-targeted
                  design yields higher affinities and success rates than
                  unconditioned RFdiffusion. All by all binding experiments show
                  that the designs have affinities ranging from 137 pM to mid nM
                  for their targets and essentially no off target binding
                  despite the sharing of beta-strand interactions, likely
                  reflecting the precise customization of interacting
                  beta-strand geometry and additional designed binder-target
                  interactions. A co-crystal structure of one such design in
                  complex with the KIT receptor is nearly identical to the
                  computational design model confirming the accuracy of the
                  design approach. The ability to robustly generate binders
                  displaying high affinity and specificity to polar interaction
                  surfaces with exposed beta-strands considerably increases the
                  range and capabilities of computational binder design.}

                  cancer risk. Yet emerging clinical and experimental evidence
                  points to progestogens [endogenous progesterone or synthetic
                  progesterone (progestin)] as the primary hormonal driver
                  underlying seemingly estrogen-associated breast cancer risk.
                  Estrogens may contribute to breast cancer risk indirectly by
                  induction of the progesterone receptor and thus amplifying
                  progesterone signaling. Large studies of hormonal
                  contraceptives suggest that the small increase in breast
                  cancer risk from hormonal contraceptives is mainly
                  attributable to progestins, not estrogens.
                  Estrogen-plus-progestin hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has
                  consistently shown an increase in breast cancer risk among
                  postmenopausal women, whereas estrogen-alone HRT has little
                  impact on breast cancer risk in naturally or surgically
                  menopausal women. In particular, the long-term follow-up of
                  the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized trials suggests
                  a benefit of estrogen alone. Recent data further indicate that
                  endogenously elevated estrogen during assisted reproductive
                  technology (ART) exhibits little adverse effect on or
                  potentially a reduction in breast cancer risk and recurrence.
                  Also, accumulating evidence suggests that inhibition of
                  progesterone signaling is a critical mechanism underlying the
                  risk-reducing and therapeutic effects of antiestrogens.
                  Estrogen HRT has shown an array of proven benefits, including
                  ameliorating menopausal symptoms and improving bone health.
                  Collective evidence thus suggests that estrogen HRT is likely
                  to offer health benefits to perimenopausal or postmenopausal
                  women, including breast cancer survivors, as well as young

                  to develop muscle strength and mass to improve sports
                  performance. Massive doping is a worldwide public health issue
                  insufficiently known by physicians in general and by
                  endocrinologists in particular. Yet, its prevalence, probably
                  underestimated, would be between 1 and 5\% at the
                  international level. Numerous deleterious effects associated
                  with A/AS abuse have been identified: inhibition of the
                  gonadotropic axis responsible for hypogonadotropic
                  hypogonadism and infertility in men, and masculinization
                  (defeminization), hirsutism and anovulation in women.
                  Metabolic (very low HDL cholesterol), hematological
                  (polycythemia), psychiatric, cardiovascular and hepatic
                  complications have also been documented. As a result,
                  anti-doping agencies have developed increasingly effective
                  techniques for detecting A/AS, both to identify and punish
                  cheating athletes and to protect the health of the greatest
                  number of them. These techniques use a combination of liquid
                  and gas chromatographic methods coupled with mass
                  spectrometry, known respectively by the acronyms LC-MS and
                  GC-MS. These detection tools have a remarkable sensitivity and
                  specificity to detect natural steroids and synthetic A/AS of
                  known structure. Furthermore, by distinguishing isotopes, it
                  is also possible to distinguish natural endogenous hormones,
                  testosterone and androgenic precursors from those administered
                  for doping purposes. For elite athletes, a "biological
                  passport" has also been introduced. It consists of monitoring
                  the evolution of steroids and their metabolites, as well as
                  other biological parameters in the blood and urine over time
                  after having established a basal state athlete signature,
                  established, a priori, without doping. Better training of
                  health professionals, general practitioners and specialists
                  should be a priority for academic institutions and medical
                  societies. It would provide them with better knowledge of the
                  populations at risk and the clinical and biological semiology
                  of male and female doping, including withdrawal syndrome
                  associated with anxiety and depression following cessation of
                  chronic A/AS use. The ultimate goal is to provide these
                  physicians with the keys to treating these patients while
                  combining medical rigor and empathy. These points will be

                  novel protein folds and assemblies with important applications
                  in research and medicine. To promote sampling of alternative

                  revolutionized protein design, enabling the creation of novel
                  proteins. However, these methods often neglect the intrinsic
                  physical realism of proteins, driven by noising dynamics that
                  lack grounding in physical principles. To address this, we
                  first introduce a physically motivated non-linear noising
                  process, grounded in classical physics, that unfolds proteins
                  into secondary structures (e.g., alpha helices, linear beta
                  sheets) while preserving topological integrity--maintaining
                  bonds, and preventing collisions. We then integrate this
                  process with the flow-matching paradigm on SE(3) to model the
                  invariant distribution of protein backbones with high
                  fidelity, incorporating sequence information to enable
                  sequence-conditioned folding and expand the generative
                  capabilities of our model. Experimental results demonstrate
                  that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance
                  in unconditional protein generation, producing more designable

                  Deep-learning-based approaches for sequence design have proven
                  highly successful for various protein design applications, but
                  many non-idealized backbones still remain out of reach for
                  current models under typical in silico success criteria. We
                  hypothesize that training objectives prioritizing native
                  sequence recovery unintentionally push models to reproduce
                  non-structural signals (e.g. phylogenetic relatedness, neutral
                  drift, or dataset sampling biases), rather than a broadly
                  generalizable structure-sequence mapping. Inspired by recent
                  work bridging sequence likelihood and fitness prediction in
                  protein language models, we introduce Caliby, a Potts
                  model-based sequence design method capable of conditioning on
                  an ensemble of structures. Conditioning on a synthetic
                  ensemble generated from an input backbone allows sampling of
                  sequences consistent with the structural constraints of the
                  ensemble while averaging out undesired biases towards the
                  native sequence. Ensemble-conditioned sequence design with
                  Caliby reduces native sequence recovery while substantially
                  improving AlphaFold2 self-consistency, outperforming
                  state-of-the-art models ProteinMPNN and ChromaDesign on both
                  native and de novo backbones. Finally, we train a variant of
                  Caliby on only soluble proteins and demonstrate in silico that
                  Protpardelle-1c binder designs that were previously deemed
                  undesignable by SolubleMPNN are actually designable under
                  SolubleCaliby, highlighting limitations of existing filtering
                  pipelines. These results suggest that Caliby can expand the de

                  our understanding of the physiochemical principles that govern
                  molecular recognition. Attempts to rationally design
                  ligand-binding proteins have met with little success, however,
                  and the computational design of protein-small-molecule
                  interfaces remains an unsolved problem. Current approaches for
                  designing ligand-binding proteins for medical and
                  biotechnological uses rely on raising antibodies against a
                  target antigen in immunized animals and/or performing
                  laboratory-directed evolution of proteins with an existing low
                  affinity for the desired ligand, neither of which allows
                  complete control over the interactions involved in binding.
                  Here we describe a general computational method for designing
                  pre-organized and shape complementary small-molecule-binding
                  sites, and use it to generate protein binders to the steroid
                  digoxigenin (DIG). Of seventeen experimentally characterized
                  designs, two bind DIG; the model of the higher affinity binder
                  has the most energetically favourable and pre-organized
                  interface in the design set. A comprehensive binding-fitness
                  landscape of this design, generated by library selections and
                  deep sequencing, was used to optimize its binding affinity to
                  a picomolar level, and X-ray co-crystal structures of two
                  variants show atomic-level agreement with the corresponding
                  computational models. The optimized binder is selective for
                  DIG over the related steroids digitoxigenin, progesterone and
                  β-oestradiol, and this steroid binding preference can be
                  reprogrammed by manipulation of explicitly designed
                  hydrogen-bonding interactions. The computational design method
                  presented here should enable the development of a new

                  physiology and pathology must be understood. Myriads of
                  proteins participate in elaborate networks of interactions and
                  perform chemical activities coordinating the life of cells. To
                  perform these often amazing tasks, proteins must move and we
                  must think of them as dynamic ensembles of three dimensional
                  structures formed first by folding the polypeptide chains so
                  as to minimize the conflicts between the interactions of their
                  constituent amino acids. It is apparent however that, even
                  when completely folded, not all conflicting interactions have
                  been resolved so the structure remains "locally frustrated".
                  Over the last decades it has become clearer that this local
                  frustration is not just a random accident but plays an
                  essential part of the inner workings of protein molecules. We
                  will review here the physical origins of the frustration
                  concept and review evidence that local frustration is
                  important for protein physiology, protein-protein recognition,
                  catalysis and allostery. Also, we highlight examples showing
                  how alterations in the local frustration patterns can be
                  linked to distinct pathologies. Finally we explore the
                  extensions of the impact of frustration in higher order levels
                  of organization of systems including gene regulatory networks
                  and the neural networks of the brain.},

                  targeting biological L-proteins is a valuable area of
                  research. To design these structuresin silico, a computational
                  workflow should correctly dock and fold a peptide while
                  maintaining chiral centers. The latest AlphaFold 3 (AF3) from
                  Abramson et al. (2024) enforces a strict chiral violation
                  penalty to maintain chiral centers from model inputs and is
                  reported to have a low chiral violation rate of only 4.4\% on
                  a PoseBusters benchmark containing diverse chiral molecules.
                  Herein, we report the results of 3,255 experiments with AF3 to
                  evaluate its ability to predict the fold, chirality, and
                  binding pose of D-peptides in heterochiral complexes. Despite
                  our inputs specifying explicit D-stereocenters, we report that
                  the AF3 chiral violation for D-peptide binders is much higher
                  at 51\% across all evaluated predictions; on average the model
                  is as accurate as chance (random chirality choice, L or D, for
                  each peptide residue). Increasing the number of seeds failed
                  to improve this violation rate. The AF3 predictions exhibit
                  incorrect folds and binding poses, with D-peptides commonly
                  oriented incorrectly in the L-protein binding pocket.
                  Confidence metrics returned by AF3 also fail to distinguish
                  predictions with low chirality violation and correct docking
                  vs. predictions with high chirality violation and incorrect
                  docking. We conclude that AF3 is a poor predictor of D-peptide

                  landscape of a protein and its dynamic flexibility remains
                  challenging. In this work, we developed Modal-aligned
                  conditional Diffusion (Mac-Diff), a score based diffusion
                  model for generating the conformational ensembles for unseen
                  proteins. Central to Mac-Diff is an innovative attention
                  module that enforces a delicate, locality-aware alignment
                  between the conditional view (protein sequence) and the target
                  view (residue pair geometry) to compute highly contextualized
                  features for effective structural denoising. Furthermore,
                  Mac-Diff leverages semantically rich sequence embedding from
                  Protein Language Models like ESM-2 in enforcing the protein
                  sequence condition that captures evolutionary, structural and
                  functional information. This compensates for protein
                  structural heterogeneity more effectively than embeddings from
                  structure prediction models that are possibly biased to the
                  dominant conformation. Mac-Diff showed promising results in
                  generating realistic and diverse protein structures. It
                  successfully recovered conformational distributions of fast
                  folding proteins, captured multiple meta-stable conformations
                  that were only observed in long MD simulation trajectories and
                  efficiently predicted alternative conformations for allosteric
                  proteins. We believe that Mac-Diff offers a useful tool to
                  improve understanding of protein dynamics and structural
                  variability, with broad implications for structural biology,

                  predicting side-chain conformation given a fixed backbone
                  structure, has important implications in modeling of
                  structures and interactions. However, despite the
                  groundbreaking progress in protein structure prediction
                  pioneered by AlphaFold, the existing PSCP methods still rely
                  on experimental inputs, and do not leverage
                  AlphaFold-predicted backbone coordinates to enable PSCP at
                  scale. Results: Here, we perform a large-scale benchmarking of
                  the predictive performance of various PSCP methods on public
                  datasets from multiple rounds of the Critical Assessment of
                  Structure Prediction (CASP) challenges using a diverse set of
                  evaluation metrics. Empirical results demonstrate that the
                  PSCP methods perform well in packing the side-chains with
                  experimental inputs, but they fail to generalize in repacking
                  AlphaFold-generated structures. We additionally explore the
                  effectiveness of leveraging the self-assessment confidence
                  scores from AlphaFold by implementing a backbone
                  confidence-aware integrative approach. While such a protocol
                  often leads to performance improvement by attaining modest yet
                  statistically significant accuracy gains over the AlphaFold
                  baseline, it does not yield consistent and pronounced
                  improvements. Our study highlights the recent advances and
                  remaining challenges in PSCP in the post-AlphaFold era.

                  diverse protein family and are targets for a broad spectrum of
                  pharmaceuticals. Technological progress in X-ray
                  crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy has enabled
                  extensive, high-resolution structural characterisation of
                  GPCRs in different conformational states. However, as highly
                  dynamic events underlie GPCR signalling, a complete
                  understanding of GPCR functionality requires insights into
                  their conformational dynamics. Here, we present a large
                  dataset of molecular dynamics simulations covering 60\% of
                  currently available GPCR structures. Our analysis reveals
                  extensive local "breathing" motions of the receptor on a nano-
                  to microsecond timescale and provides access to numerous
                  previously unexplored receptor conformational states.
                  Furthermore, we reveal that receptor flexibility impacts the
                  shape of allosteric drug binding sites, which frequently adopt
                  partially or completely closed states in the absence of a
                  molecular modulator. We demonstrate that exploring membrane
                  lipid dynamics and their interaction with GPCRs is an
                  efficient approach to expose such hidden allosteric sites and
                  even lateral ligand entrance gateways. The obtained insights

                  Proteolytic cleavage of the main structural polyprotein Gag
                  into functional domains induces rearrangement into mature,
                  infectious virions. In immature virus particles, the Gag
                  membrane-binding domain, MA, forms a hexameric protein lattice
                  that undergoes structural transition, following cleavage, into
                  a distinct, mature MA lattice1. The mechanism of MA lattice
                  maturation is unknown. Here we show that released spacer
                  peptide 2 (SP2), a conserved peptide of unknown function
                  situated about 300 residues downstream of MA, binds MA to
                  induce structural maturation. By high-resolution in-virus
                  structure determination of MA, we show that MA does not bind
                  lipid into a side pocket as previously thought1, but instead
                  binds SP2 as an integral part of the protein-protein
                  interfaces that stabilize the mature lattice. Analysis of Gag
                  cleavage site mutants showed that SP2 release is required for
                  MA maturation, and we demonstrate that SP2 is sufficient to
                  induce maturation of purified MA on lipid monolayers in vitro.
                  SP2-triggered MA maturation correlated with faster fusion of
                  virus with target cells. Our results reveal a new, unexpected

                  activation model, agonist binding is required for receptor-G
                  protein complex formation, while antagonists prevent G protein
                  coupling. However, many GPCRs exhibit basal activity, allowing
                  G protein association without an agonist. The pharmacological
                  impact of agonist-free receptor-G protein complexes is poorly

                  lipid nanodiscs paired with molecular dynamics simulations to
                  elucidate at the atomic scale the allosteric dialog between
                  the lipid bilayer and a bacterial model membrane protein,
                  OmpX. We discover that OmpX delays the gelation process by
                  liquefying the annular shell of lipids through hydrophobic and
                  roughness matching processes at the protein surface.
                  Furthermore, the alteration of the mechanical properties of
                  the lipid bilayer directly impacts the energy landscape of
                  amino acid side chains at the lipid/protein interface, but
                  also, unexpectedly, at the protein core. Our work highlights a
                  potential thermodynamically coupled but kinetically uncoupled
                  allosteric pathway linking lipid dynamics with the interior of
                  membrane proteins, directly impacting our understanding of

                  hsPEX19 variants binds to the N17 domain of mHttex1, thereby
                  inhibiting the initial aggregation process. Overexpression of

                  proteins with diverse functionalities that are not found in
                  nature. Despite recent advances, experimental success rates
                  remain inconsistent and context-dependent, posing a bottleneck
                  for broader applications of de novo design. To overcome this,
                  structure and sequence prediction models have been applied to
                  assess design quality prior to experimental testing to save
                  time and resources. In this study, we aimed to determine the
                  extent to which AlphaFold2, Protein MPNN, and ESMFold can
                  discriminate between experimentally successful and
                  unsuccessful designs. For this, we curated a benchmark dataset
                  of 614 experimentally characterized de novo designed monomers
                  from 11 different design studies between 2012 and 2021. All
                  predictive models demonstrated moderate ability to
                  discriminate experimental successes (expressed, soluble,
                  monomeric, and fold into the intended design structure) from
                  failures, with many failed designs having better confidence
                  metrics than successful designs. Among all computational
                  models evaluated, ESMFold average pLDDT yielded the best
                  individual performance at distinguishing between successful
                  and unsuccessful designs. A logistic regression model
                  combining all confidence metrics provided only modest
                  improvement over ESMFold pLDDT alone. Overall, these results
                  show that these models can serve as an initial filtering
                  strategy prior to experimental validation; however, their
                  utility at accurately predicting experimental successful
                  designs remains limited without task-specific training.}

                  revised, discarded, and replaced. But when are such changes to
                  the content of science improvements on what came before? This
                  is the question of scientific progress. One answer is that
                  progress occurs when scientific theories “get closer to the
                  truth,” i.e., increase their degree of truthlikeness. A second
                  answer is that progress consists in increasing theories'
                  effectiveness for solving scientific problems. A third answer
                  is that progress occurs when the stock of scientific knowledge
                  accumulates. A fourth and final answer is that scientific
                  progress consists in increasing scientific understanding,i.e.,
                  the capacity to correctly explain and reliably predict

              universal practices among authors or publishers. A mere 10\% of
              surveyed biology journals require sharing analysis code. This
              abysmal status quo needs to be changed. Experimental biology
              communities show there is a path forward. Depositing
              macromolecular structure data in the Protein Data Bank was
              initially voluntary. Leadership from structural biologists about
              the importance of mandatory data deposition led to the creation of
              policies and their subsequent uptake at journals. Likewise,
              genomics researchers pioneered data sharing principles that guided
              funding agency policies. The scientific community must show
              similar resolve in establishing and uniformly applying policies
              for open AI in biomedicine.},

                  complexes organize chromosomes. While most prokaryotes have
                  one, eukaryotes usually possess four (condensin I, condensin
                  II, cohesin, and SMC5/6), shaping their considerably larger
                  genomes. Although essential, SMC complexes differ among model
                  eukaryotes, suggesting underexplored diversity. Here, we
                  reconstruct eukaryotic SMC complex evolution, revealing that
                  the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) had all four
                  complexes, supporting a sophisticated LECA. Subsequently,
                  condensin II was lost at least 30 times, making it one of the
                  most frequently lost eukaryotic machineries. Moreover,
                  multiple SMC complex components are more ancient and
                  widespread than previously appreciated. Tracing prokaryotic

                  common diffusion channels, predominantly monomeric/trimeric in

                  predator Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, PopA, differs from this
                  architecture, forming a pentameric porin-like superstructure.
                  Our X-ray and cryo-EM structures reveal a bowl-shape composite
                  outer β-wall, which houses a central chamber that encloses a
                  section of the lipid bilayer. We demonstrate that PopA,
                  reported to insert into prey inner membrane, causes defects
                  when directed into Escherichia coli membranes. We discover
                  widespread PopA homologues, including likely tetramers and

                  While discrete diffusion models have demonstrated strong
                  performance, existing methods often apply uniform denoising
                  across residues, overlooking position-specific uncertainty. We
                  propose an uncertainty-aware discrete denoising diffusion
                  model that employs a prior-posterior signaling mechanism to
                  dynamically guide the denoising process. Our approach further

                  language model and a structure encoder within a modular
                  framework, jointly optimized through multi-objective training.
                  Across multiple benchmarks, our method achieves substantial

                  (GNNs), for 3D applications such as protein structure
                  modelling. These hybrids typically involve either (1)
                  preprocessing/tokenizing structural features as input for
                  Transformers or (2) taking Transformer embeddings and
                  processing them within a structural representation. However,
                  there is evidence that Transformers can learn to process

                  then validate this theory using both simulated 3D points and
                  in the context of masked token prediction for proteins.
                  Finally, we show that pre-training protein Transformer
                  encoders with structure improves performance on a downstream

                  for protein design, existing computational pipelines remain
                  rigid, highly specific, and ill-suited for tasks requiring
                  non-differentiable or multi-objective design goals. In this
                  report, we introduce BAGEL , a modular, open-source framework
                  for programmable protein engineering, enabling flexible
                  exploration of sequence space through model-agnostic and
                  gradient-free exploration of an energy landscape. BAGEL
                  formalizes protein design as the sampling of an energy
                  function, either to optimize (find a global optimum) or to
                  explore a basin of interest (generate diverse candidates).
                  This energy function is composed of user-defined terms
                  capturing geometric constraints, sequence embedding
                  similarities, or structural confidence metrics. BAGEL also
                  natively supports multi-state optimization and advanced Monte
                  Carlo techniques, providing researchers with a flexible
                  alternative to fixed-backbone and inverse-folding paradigms
                  common in current design workflows. Moreover, the package
                  seamlessly integrates a wide range of publicly available deep
                  learning protein models, allowing users to rapidly take full
                  advantage of any future improvements in model accuracy and
                  speed. We illustrate the versatility of BAGEL on four
                  archetypal applications: designing de novo peptide binders,
                  targeting intrinsically disordered epitopes, selectively
                  binding to species-specific variants, and generating enzyme
                  variants with conserved catalytic sites. By offering a
                  modular, easy-to-use platform to define custom protein design
                  objectives and optimization strategies, BAGEL aims to speed up
                  the design of new proteins. Our goal with its release is to
                  democratize protein design, abstracting the process as much as
                  possible from technical implementation details and thereby
                  making it more accessible to the broader scientific community,
                  unlocking untapped potential for innovation in biotechnology
                  and therapeutics.}

                  molecules, such as biofluids, to enable early disease
                  detection. Moreover, to our knowledge, there is currently no
                  detection method capable of identifying the different
                  conformations of a peptide biomarker differing by a single
                  amino acid. Single-molecule nanopore sensing promises to
                  provide this level of resolution. In order to be able to
                  identify these differences in a biofluid such as serum, it is
                  necessary to carefully characterize electrical parameters to
                  obtain specific signatures of each biomarker population
                  observed. We are interested here in a family of peptide
                  biomarkers, kinins such as bradykinin and des-Arg9 bradykinin,
                  that are involved in many disabling pathologies (allergy,
                  asthma, angioedema, sepsis, or cancer). We show the proof of
                  concept for direct identification of these biomarkers in serum
                  at the single-molecule level using a protein nanopore. Each
                  peptide exhibits two unique electrical signatures attributed
                  to specific conformations in bulk. The same signatures are
                  found in serum, allowing their discrimination and
                  identification in a complex mixture such as biofluid. To
                  extend the utility of our experimental results, we developed a
                  principal component analysis approach to define the most
                  relevant electrical parameters for their identification.
                  Finally, we used semisupervised classification to assign each
                  event type to a specific biomarker at physiological serum
                  concentration. In the future, single-molecule scale analysis
                  of peptide biomarkers using a powerful nanopore coupled with
                  machine learning will facilitate the identification and
                  quantification of other clinically relevant biomarkers from

                  Cell-Free Two-Hybrid (CF2H), a rapid and sensitive method for
                  detecting high-affinity protein-protein interactions (PPI)
                  that does not require cloning, protein purification nor

                  and bait proteins to trigger transcription upon

                  and binder proteins such as single-domain antibodies, DARPins

                  and discover high-affinity binders targeting the checkpoint
                  inhibitor PD-L1 in less than 24 hours. Finally, we show that

                  accurately model their nanofluidic properties is currently
                  unavailable. This limits the rational engineering of nanopore
                  traits and makes the unambiguous interpretation of
                  experimental results challenging. Here, we present a continuum
                  approach that can faithfully reproduce the experimentally
                  measured ionic conductance of the biological nanopore
                  Cytolysin A (ClyA) over a wide range of ionic strengths and
                  bias potentials. Our model consists of the extended
                  Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Navier-Stokes (ePNP-NS) equations
                  and a computationally efficient 2D-axisymmetric representation
                  for the geometry and charge distribution of the nanopore.
                  Importantly, the ePNP-NS equations achieve this accuracy by
                  self-consistently considering the finite size of the ions and
                  the influence of both the ionic strength and the nanoscopic
                  scale of the pore on the local properties of the electrolyte.
                  These comprise the mobility and diffusivity of the ions, and
                  the density, viscosity and relative permittivity of the
                  solvent. Crucially, by applying our methodology to ClyA, a
                  biological nanopore used for single-molecule enzymology
                  studies, we could directly quantify several nanofluidic
                  characteristics difficult to determine experimentally. These
                  include the ion selectivity, the ion concentration
                  distributions, the electrostatic potential landscape, the
                  magnitude of the electro-osmotic flow field, and the internal

                  alignment accuracy. To date, no cryo-EM structures have been
                  reported for proteins near this size limit. This study
                  presents cryo-EM structures of two protein-ligand complexes
                  around 40 kDa. The structure of maltose-binding protein (43

                  and in the maintenance of an adult mammalian organism. On the
                  molecular level, they regulate a plethora of biological
                  pathways. Part of their actions depends on their
                  transcription-regulating properties, exerted by highly
                  specific nuclear receptors which are hormone-dependent
                  transcription factors. Nuclear hormone receptors interact with
                  coactivators, corepressors, basal transcription factors, and
                  other transcription factors in order to modulate the activity
                  of target genes in a manner that is dependent on tissue, age
                  and developmental and pathophysiological states. The
                  biological effect of this mechanism becomes apparent not
                  earlier than 30-60 minutes after hormonal stimulus. In
                  addition, small-molecule hormones modify the function of the
                  cell by a number of nongenomic mechanisms, involving
                  interaction with proteins localized in the plasma membrane, in
                  the cytoplasm, as well as with proteins localized in other
                  cellular membranes and in nonnuclear cellular compartments.
                  The identity of such proteins is still under investigation;
                  however, it seems that extranuclear fractions of nuclear
                  hormone receptors commonly serve this function. A direct
                  interaction of small-molecule hormones with membrane
                  phospholipids and with mRNA is also postulated. In these
                  mechanisms, the reaction to hormonal stimulus appears within
                  seconds or minutes.},

                  linked to dynein and its cofactor dynactin has started to
                  emerge. Of particular importance for this process is a set of

                  joining is established and structural data showing eIF5B bound
                  to the full ribosome were obtained. To achieve its function,
                  eIF5B collaborates with eIF1A. However, structural data
                  illustrating how these two factors interact on the small
                  ribosomal subunit have long been awaited. The role of the
                  archaeal counterparts, aIF5B and aIF1A, remains to be
                  extensively addressed. Here, we study the late steps of
                  Pyrococcus abyssi translation initiation. Using in vitro
                  reconstituted initiation complexes and light scattering, we
                  show that aIF5B bound to GTP accelerates subunit joining

                  analyze domain movements associated to these two nucleotide

                  aIF5B and aIF1A at 2.7 Å resolution. Structural data shows how
                  archaeal 5B and 1A factors cooperate to induce a conformation
                  of the initiator tRNA favorable to subunit joining. Archaeal

                  revolutionary idea was borne out of the realization that a
                  large fraction of the extracellular matrix that holds
                  Gram-negative cells into a persistent biofilm is composed of
                  protein fibers (curli; tafi) with cross-β architecture,

                  diversity of protein molecules1, but the full potential of
                  proteins is likely to be much greater. Accessing this
                  potential has been challenging for both computation and
                  experiments because the space of possible protein molecules is
                  much larger than the space of those likely to have functions.
                  Here we introduce Chroma, a generative model for proteins and
                  protein complexes that can directly sample novel protein
                  structures and sequences, and that can be conditioned to steer
                  the generative process towards desired properties and
                  functions. To enable this, we introduce a diffusion process
                  that respects the conformational statistics of polymer
                  ensembles, an efficient neural architecture for molecular
                  systems that enables long-range reasoning with sub-quadratic
                  scaling, layers for efficiently synthesizing three-dimensional
                  structures of proteins from predicted inter-residue geometries
                  and a general low-temperature sampling algorithm for diffusion
                  models. Chroma achieves protein design as Bayesian inference
                  under external constraints, which can involve symmetries,
                  substructure, shape, semantics and even natural-language
                  prompts. The experimental characterization of 310 proteins
                  shows that sampling from Chroma results in proteins that are
                  highly expressed, fold and have favourable biophysical

                  integral components of the dynein transport machinery, as they
                  recognize cargoes for cell cycle-specific transport and link
                  them to the motor complex. Human BicD2 switches from selecting
                  secretory and Golgi-derived vesicles for transport in G1 and S
                  phase (by recognizing Rab6GTP), to selecting the nucleus for
                  transport in G2 phase (by recognizing nuclear pore protein
                  Nup358), but the molecular mechanisms governing this switch
                  are elusive. Here, we have developed a quantitative model for
                  BicD2/cargo interactions that integrates affinities,
                  oligomeric states, and cellular concentrations of the
                  reactants. BicD2 and cargo form predominantly 2:2 complexes.
                  Furthermore, the affinity of BicD2 toward its cargo Nup358 is
                  higher than that toward Rab6GTP. Based on our calculations, an
                  estimated 1000 BicD2 molecules per cell would be recruited to
                  the nucleus through Nup358 in the absence of regulation.
                  Notably, RanGTP is a negative regulator of the Nup358/BicD2
                  interaction that weakens the affinity by a factor of 10 and
                  may play a role in averting dynein recruitment to the nucleus
                  outside of the G2 phase. However, our quantitative model
                  predicts that an additional negative regulator remains to be
                  identified. In the absence of negative regulation, the
                  affinity of Nup358 would likely be sufficient to recruit BicD2
                  to the nucleus in G2 phase. Our quantitative model makes
                  testable predictions of how cellular transport events are
                  orchestrated. These transport processes are important for
                  brain development, cell cycle control, signaling, and
                  neurotransmission at synapses.},

                  enabled the creation of novel proteins for a variety of

                  high-quality backbones for very large proteins would further
                  expand the scope of protein design. To this end, here we
                  introduce the AlphaFold2 (AF2) cycler (af2cycler) design
                  pipeline. AF2cycler is used to refine draft protein backbone
                  geometries of arbitrary shape created by the Chroma diffusion
                  model or other methods, using a combination of AF2 and
                  ProteinMPNN to achieve high designability with minimal
                  deviations from the initial target structure. In silico
                  testing on multiple protein designs (100-1000 amino acids)
                  demonstrated improvements in structural integrity and
                  designability after af2cycling confirmed by enhanced ESMFold
                  repredictions. Experimental wet lab validation through the
                  design of a variety of test proteins with distinct shapes,
                  each comprising 1000 amino acids, showed structural agreement
                  between in silico predictions and transmission electron
                  microscopy (TEM) imaging, establishing the af2cycler’s
                  efficacy in translating designs into real-world results.
                  Af2cycler provides a convenient and reliable protein design
                  workflow, particularly for large proteins, with potential for
                  expanding to applications in areas such as design of

                  language processing fine-tuning large language models has

                  supervised fine-tuning almost always improves downstream
                  predictions. Secondly, parameter-efficient fine-tuning can
                  reach similar improvements consuming substantially fewer
                  resources at up to 4.5-fold acceleration of training over
                  fine-tuning full models. Our results suggest to always try
                  fine-tuning, in particular for problems with small datasets,
                  such as for fitness landscape predictions of a single protein.

                  three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid
                  sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the
                  structure of a protein largely determines its function2;
                  however, protein structures can be difficult to determine
                  experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made
                  by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer
                  which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing
                  covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the
                  prediction of protein structures3. Here we show that we can
                  train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the
                  distances between pairs of residues, which convey more
                  information about the structure than contact predictions.
                  Using this information, we construct a potential of mean
                  force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We
                  find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple
                  gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without
                  complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named
                  AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with
                  fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment
                  of Protein Structure Prediction5 (CASP13)-a blind assessment
                  of the state of the field-AlphaFold created high-accuracy
                  structures (with template modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or
                  higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the
                  next best method, which used sampling and contact information,
                  achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains.
                  AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in
                  protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased
                  accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction
                  of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for
                  homologous proteins have been experimentally determined7.},

                  proteins using deep-learning methods1-9. Despite this
                  progress, a general deep-learning framework for protein design
                  that enables solution of a wide range of design challenges,
                  including de novo binder design and design of higher-order
                  symmetric architectures, has yet to be described. Diffusion
                  models10,11 have had considerable success in image and
                  language generative modelling but limited success when applied
                  to protein modelling, probably due to the complexity of
                  protein backbone geometry and sequence-structure
                  relationships. Here we show that by fine-tuning the
                  RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure
                  denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein
                  backbones that achieves outstanding performance on
                  unconditional and topology-constrained protein monomer design,
                  protein binder design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme
                  active site scaffolding and symmetric motif scaffolding for
                  therapeutic and metal-binding protein design. We demonstrate
                  the power and generality of the method, called RoseTTAFold
                  diffusion (RFdiffusion), by experimentally characterizing the
                  structures and functions of hundreds of designed symmetric
                  assemblies, metal-binding proteins and protein binders. The
                  accuracy of RFdiffusion is confirmed by the cryogenic electron

                  influenza haemagglutinin that is nearly identical to the
                  design model. In a manner analogous to networks that produce
                  images from user-specified inputs, RFdiffusion enables the
                  design of diverse functional proteins from simple molecular

                  revealed nanomolar to low micromolar binding affinities and
                  atomic-level design accuracy. The bound ligands are exposed at

                  variety of imperfections. Although this fact has been pointed
                  out in the past, it is still worth periodic updates so that
                  the metadata obtained by global analysis of the available
                  crystal structures, as well as the utilization of the
                  individual structures for tasks such as drug design, should be
                  based on only the most reliable data. Here, selected abnormal
                  deposited structures have been analysed based on the Bayesian
                  reasoning that the correctness of a model must be judged
                  against both the primary evidence as well as prior knowledge.
                  These structures, as well as information gained from the
                  corresponding publications (if available), have emphasized
                  some of the most prevalent types of common problems. The
                  errors are often perfect illustrations of the nature of human
                  cognition, which is frequently influenced by preconceptions
                  that may lead to fanciful results in the absence of proper
                  validation. Common errors can be traced to negligence and a
                  lack of rigorous verification of the models against electron
                  density, creation of non-parsimonious models, generation of
                  improbable numbers, application of incorrect symmetry,
                  illogical presentation of the results, or violation of the
                  rules of chemistry and physics. Paying more attention to such
                  problems, not only in the final validation stages but during
                  the structure-determination process as well, is necessary not
                  only in order to maintain the highest possible quality of the
                  structural repositories and databases but most of all to
                  provide a solid basis for subsequent studies, including
                  large-scale data-mining projects. For many scientists PDB
                  deposition is a rather infrequent event, so the need for
                  proper training and supervision is emphasized, as well as the

                  absolutely necessary safeguarding measures against such
                  problems. Ways of identifying more problematic structures are
                  suggested so that their users may be properly alerted to their

                  In each case, dynein is recruited to the nuclear envelope (NE)
                  specifically during G2 via two nuclear pore-mediated
                  mechanisms involving RanBP2-BicD2 and Nup133-CENP-F. The

                  controller for NE dynein recruitment in neural stem cells and
                  HeLa cells. Cdk1 phosphorylates conserved sites within RanBP2

                  recruitment is triggered by a Cdk1-induced export of CENP-F

                  computational design because of their considerable functional
                  diversity despite their very small size (<70 amino acids).
                  However, there are considerable challenges to designing such
                  structures, and there has been little success thus far.
                  Because of the small size, the hydrophobic core stabilizing
                  the fold is necessarily very small, and the conformational
                  strain of barrel closure can oppose folding; also
                  intermolecular aggregation through free beta strand edges can
                  compete with proper monomer folding. Here, we explore the de
                  novo design of small beta barrel topologies using both Rosetta
                  energy-based methods and deep learning approaches to design
                  four small beta barrel folds: Src homology 3 (SH3) and
                  oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) topologies found
                  in nature and five and six up-and-down-stranded barrels rarely
                  if ever seen in nature. Both approaches yielded successful
                  designs with high thermal stability and experimentally
                  determined structures with less than 2.4 Å rmsd from the
                  designed models. Using deep learning for backbone generation
                  and Rosetta for sequence design yielded higher design success
                  rates and increased structural diversity than Rosetta alone.
                  The ability to design a large and structurally diverse set of
                  small beta barrel proteins greatly increases the protein shape

                  diseases characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of
                  hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Malignant cell
                  growth is characterized by disruption of normal intracellular
                  signaling, caused by mutations or aberrant external signaling.
                  The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mammalian target of
                  rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway) is among one
                  of the intracellular pathways aberrantly upregulated in
                  cancers including AML. Activation of this pathway seems
                  important in leukemogenesis, and given the central role of
                  this pathway in metabolism, the bioenergetics of AML cells may
                  depend on downstream signaling within this pathway.
                  Furthermore, observations suggest that constitutive activation
                  of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway differs between patients, and
                  that increased activity within this pathway is an adverse

                  PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway with specific inhibitors results in
                  suppression of leukemic cell growth. However, AML patients
                  seem to differ regarding their susceptibility to various
                  small-molecule inhibitors, reflecting biological heterogeneity
                  in the intracellular signaling status. These findings should

                  settings, along with the potential use of this pathway as a
                  prognostic biomarker, both in patients receiving intensive
                  curative AML treatment and in elderly/unfit receiving

                  Ground-breaking research has centered around unraveling the
                  characteristics of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA)
                  and the nuanced archaeal and bacterial contributions in
                  eukaryogenesis, resulting in fundamental changes in our
                  understanding of the Tree of Life. The archaeal and bacterial
                  roles are covered by theories of endosymbiogenesis wherein an
                  ancestral host archaeon and a bacterial endosymbiont merged to
                  create a new complex cell type - Eukarya - and its
                  mitochondrion. Eukarya is often regarded as a unique and
                  distinct domain due to complex innovations not found in
                  archaea or bacteria, despite housing a chimeric genome
                  containing genes of both archaeal and bacterial origin.
                  However, the discovery of complex cell machineries in recently
                  described Asgard archaeal lineages, and the growing support
                  for diverse bacterial gene transfers prior to and during the
                  time of LECA, is redefining our understanding of
                  eukaryogenesis. Indeed, the uniqueness of Eukarya, as a
                  domain, is challenged. It is likely that many microbial
                  syntrophies, encompassing a 'microbial village', were required

  abstract     = {Amyloid fibrils are best known as a product of human and
                  animal protein misfolding disorders, where amyloid formation
                  is associated with cytotoxicity and disease. It is now evident
                  that for some proteins, the amyloid state constitutes the
                  native structure and serves a functional role. These
                  functional amyloids are proving widespread in bacteria and
                  fungi, fulfilling diverse functions as structural components
                  in biofilms or spore coats, as toxins and surface-active
                  fibers, as epigenetic material, peptide reservoirs or adhesins
                  mediating binding to and internalization into host cells. In
                  this review, we will focus on the role of functional amyloids
                  in bacterial pathogenesis. The role of functional amyloids as
                  virulence factor is diverse but mostly indirect. Nevertheless,
                  functional amyloid pathways deserve consideration for the
                  acute and long-term effects of the infectious disease process
                  and may form valid antimicrobial targets.},

                  while disordered, and they may fold to structured
                  conformations on binding. Here we show that the cis/trans
                  isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds can have a pronounced
                  effect on the interactions of IDPs. By single-molecule
                  spectroscopy, we identify a conserved proline residue in NCBD
                  (the nuclear-coactivator binding domain of CBP) whose
                  cis/trans isomerization in the unbound state modulates the
                  association and dissociation rates with its binding partner,
                  ACTR. As a result, NCBD switches on a time scale of tens of
                  seconds between two populations that differ in their

                  enzyme active site annotation algorithm that fuses latent
                  enzyme representations from the Protein Language Model and 3D
                  structural encoder, and then aligns protein-level information
                  with the knowledge of enzymatic reactions using a multi-modal

                  Diffusion models10,11have had considerable success in image
                  and language generative modeling but limited success when
                  applied to protein modeling, likely due to the complexity of
                  protein backbone geometry and sequence-structure
                  relationships. Here we show that by fine tuning the
                  RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure
                  denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein

                  that give rise to neurons, glia, and adult stem cells during

                  apically using cytoplasmic dynein during G2, and undergo
                  mitosis at the ventricular surface. By live imaging of in
                  utero electroporated rat brain, we find that two distinct
                  G2-specific mechanisms for dynein nuclear pore recruitment are
                  essential for apical nuclear migration. The "RanBP2-BicD2" and

                  extending the approaches used in Global Distance Test (GDT)1

                  exploited to eliminate the inherent protein size dependence of
                  the previous scores and appropriately account for random
                  protein structure pairs. Second, rather than setting specific
                  distance cutoffs and calculating only the fractions with
                  errors below the cutoff, all residue pairs in
                  alignment/modeling are evaluated in the proposed score. For
                  comparison of various scoring functions, we have constructed a
                  large-scale benchmark set of structure templates for 1489
                  small to medium size proteins using the threading program

                  stronger correlation to the quality of the final full-length
                  models. The TM-score is further exploited as an assessment of
                  all 'new fold' targets in the recent CASP5 experiment and
                  shows a close coincidence with the results of human-expert
                  visual assessment. These data suggest that the TM-score is a

                  where predicted AlphaFold2 structures are embedded into the
                  membrane plane and a quality assessment (plausibility of the
                  membrane-embedded structure) is provided for each prediction
                  using geometrical evaluation. In this paper, we analyze how
                  AF2 has improved the structural coverage of membrane proteins
                  compared to earlier years when only experimental structures
                  were available, and high-throughput structure prediction was
                  greatly limited. We also evaluate how AF2 can be used to
                  search for (distant) homologs in highly diverse protein
                  families. By combining quality assessment and homology search,
                  we can pinpoint protein families where AF2 accuracy is still
                  limited, and experimental structure determination would be
                  desirable.},

                  co-activate protein kinase B (PKB, also named Akt) by binding

                  fluorescence anisotropy, NMR, and small angle x-ray-scattering
                  measurements to determine the affinities, molecular

                  trans-phosphorylation, hinder deactivation of PKB, and involve
                  PKB in a multi-protein complex, explaining the array of known

                  the labor-intensive production of heavy-atom derivatives and
                  seleno-methio-nyl substitutions. The native-SAD method is
                  particularly attractive for membrane proteins, which are
                  difficult to produce and often recalcitrant to grow into
                  decent-sized crystals. Native-SAD uses lower-energy X-rays to
                  enhance anomalous signals from sulfur or phospho-rus. However,
                  at lower energies, the scattering and absorption of air
                  contribute to the background noise, reduce the signals and are
                  thus adverse to native-SAD phasing. We have previously

                  anomalous diffraction data at 5 keV for two proteins:
                  thaumatin and the membrane protein TehA. Although anomalous
                  signals from each individual crystal are very weak, robust
                  anomalous signals are obtained from data assembled from
                  micrometre-sized crystals. The thaumatin structure was
                  determined from 15 microcrystals and the TehA structure from
                  18 microcrystals. These results demonstrate the usefulness of

                  broad range of sensing applications. Current engineering
                  approaches for nanopore sensors are limited to naturally
                  occurring channels, which provide suboptimal starting points.
                  By contrast, de novo protein design can in principle create an
                  unlimited number of new nanopores with any desired properties.
                  Here we describe a general approach to designing transmembrane
                  β-barrel pores with different diameters and pore geometries.
                  Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystallographic
                  characterization show that the designs are stably folded with
                  structures resembling those of the design models. The designs
                  have distinct conductances that correlate with their pore
                  diameter, ranging from 110 picosiemens (~0.5 nanometer pore
                  diameter) to 430 picosiemens (~1.1 nanometer pore diameter).
                  Our approach opens the door to the custom design of
                  transmembrane nanopores for sensing and sequencing
                  applications. Editor’s summary Beta-barrel proteins are simple
                  in structure but have complex requirements for the proper
                  folding and conduction of ions and small molecules across a
                  membrane. Berhanu et al. developed an approach to designing
                  beta-barrel proteins with a range of transmembrane strands and
                  geometries ranging from oval to square to triangular.
                  Important in their design is incorporating breaks in the
                  secondary structure to prevent aggregation and to facilitate
                  folding into the membrane. The authors showed that these
                  proteins conduct ions and have properties that will be
                  advantageous for applications in sensing. —Michael A. Funk}

                  find "good" amino acid sequences (i) that fold to a desired
                  "target" structure as a native conformation of lowest
                  accessible free energy and (ii) that will not simultaneously
                  fold to many other conformations of the same free energy?
                  Current protein designs often focus on helix propensities and
                  turns. We focus here on designing the hydrophobicity. For a
                  model of self-avoiding hydrophobic/polar chains on
                  two-dimensional square lattices, geometric proofs and
                  exhaustive enumerations show the following results. (i) The
                  strategy hydrophobic residues inside/polar residues outside is
                  not optimal. Placement of additional hydrophobic residues on
                  the surface is often necessary. (ii) To avoid unwanted
                  conformations, the designed sequence must have neither too
                  many nor too few hydrophobic residues. (iii) The computational
                  complexity of inverse folding appears to be in a different
                  class than folding: unlike the folding problem, the design
                  problem does not scale exponentially with chain length. Some
                  design strategies, described here for the lattice model,
                  produce good sequences and scale only linearly with chain

                  between protein and DNA, is often achieved by varying bases or
                  side chains coming off the DNA or protein backbone-for
                  example, the bases participating in Watson-Crick pairing in
                  the double helix, or the side chains contacting DNA in
                  TALEN-DNA complexes. By contrast, specificity of
                  protein-protein interactions usually involves backbone shape
                  complementarity1, which is less modular and hence harder to
                  generalize. Coiled-coil heterodimers are an exception, but the
                  restricted geometry of interactions across the heterodimer
                  interface (primarily at the heptad a and d positions2) limits
                  the number of orthogonal pairs that can be created simply by
                  varying side-chain interactions3,4. Here we show that
                  protein-protein interaction specificity can be achieved using
                  extensive and modular side-chain hydrogen-bond networks. We
                  used the Crick generating equations5 to produce millions of
                  four-helix backbones with varying degrees of supercoiling
                  around a central axis, identified those accommodating
                  extensive hydrogen-bond networks, and used Rosetta to connect
                  pairs of helices with short loops and to optimize the
                  remainder of the sequence. Of 97 such designs expressed in
                  Escherichia coli, 65 formed constitutive heterodimers, and the
                  crystal structures of four designs were in close agreement
                  with the computational models and confirmed the designed
                  hydrogen-bond networks. In cells, six heterodimers were fully
                  orthogonal, and in vitro-following mixing of 32 chains from 16
                  heterodimer designs, denaturation in 5 M guanidine
                  hydrochloride and reannealing-almost all of the interactions
                  observed by native mass spectrometry were between the designed
                  cognate pairs. The ability to design orthogonal protein
                  heterodimers should enable sophisticated protein-based control
                  logic for synthetic biology, and illustrates that nature has

                  structure prediction using deep neural networks to predict
                  inter-residue distances from amino acid sequences1-3. Here we
                  investigate whether the information captured by such networks
                  is sufficiently rich to generate new folded proteins with
                  sequences unrelated to those of the naturally occurring
                  proteins used in training the models. We generate random amino
                  acid sequences, and input them into the trRosetta structure
                  prediction network to predict starting residue-residue
                  distance maps, which, as expected, are quite featureless. We
                  then carry out Monte Carlo sampling in amino acid sequence
                  space, optimizing the contrast (Kullback-Leibler divergence)
                  between the inter-residue distance distributions predicted by
                  the network and background distributions averaged over all
                  proteins. Optimization from different random starting points
                  resulted in novel proteins spanning a wide range of sequences
                  and predicted structures. We obtained synthetic genes encoding
                  129 of the network-'hallucinated' sequences, and expressed and
                  purified the proteins in Escherichia coli; 27 of the proteins
                  yielded monodisperse species with circular dichroism spectra
                  consistent with the hallucinated structures. We determined the
                  three-dimensional structures of three of the hallucinated
                  proteins, two by X-ray crystallography and one by NMR, and
                  these closely matched the hallucinated models. Thus, deep
                  networks trained to predict native protein structures from
                  their sequences can be inverted to design new proteins, and
                  such networks and methods should contribute alongside
                  traditional physics-based models to the de novo design of
                  proteins with new functions.},

                  preorganizing histidine residues in buried hydrogen-bond

                  biological processes, yet it remains challenging to
                  predictively design this functionality de novo. Current
                  state-of-the-art computational design methods typically rely
                  on existing small molecule binding sites or protein scaffolds
                  with existing shape complementarity for a target ligand. Here
                  we introduce new methods that utilize pools of discrete
                  contacts between protein side chains and defined small
                  molecule ligand substructures (ligand fragments) observed in
                  the Protein Data Bank. We use the Rosetta Molecular Modeling
                  Suite to recombine protein side chains in these contact pools
                  to generate hundreds of thousands of energetically favorable
                  binding sites for a target ligand. These composite binding
                  sites are built into existing scaffold proteins matching the
                  intended binding site geometry with high accuracy. In
                  addition, we apply pools of side chain rotamers interacting

  abstract     = {Allosteric regulation of protein function is widespread in
                  biology, but is challenging for de novo protein design as it
                  requires the explicit design of multiple states with
                  comparable free energies. Here we explore the possibility of
                  designing switchable protein systems de novo, through the
                  modulation of competing inter- and intramolecular
                  interactions. We design a static, five-helix 'cage' with a
                  single interface that can interact either intramolecularly
                  with a terminal 'latch' helix or intermolecularly with a
                  peptide 'key'. Encoded on the latch are functional motifs for
                  binding, degradation or nuclear export that function only when
                  the key displaces the latch from the cage. We describe
                  orthogonal cage-key systems that function in vitro, in yeast
                  and in mammalian cells with up to 40-fold activation of
                  function by key. The ability to design switchable protein
                  functions that are controlled by induced conformational change
                  is a milestone for de novo protein design, and opens up new
                  avenues for synthetic biology and cell engineering.},

  abstract     = {AbstractWe describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF)
                  for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with
                  existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids,
                  and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical
                  molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens.
                  It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom
                  types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to
                  estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The
                  performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I,
                  74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized
                  structures, with a root‐mean‐square displacement of 0.26 Å,
                  which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field
                  (0.25 Å) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and
                  0.44 Å, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations
                  were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the
                  minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared
                  to MP2/6‐31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative
                  energies were 0.25 Å and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These
                  data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Å and
                  1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to
                  these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of
                  71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the
                  Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies
                  (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be
                  applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion,
                  making it suitable for rational drug design and database
                  searching. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 25:

                  Powerful analytical methods have identified thousands of
                  phosphorylation sites, but many of their functions remain to
                  be deciphered. A key to understanding the function of protein
                  phosphorylation is access to phosphorylated proteins, but this
                  is often challenging or impossible. Here we evolve an

                  the efficient incorporation of phosphoserine (pSer (1)) into

                  AlphaFold [1] model, the prediction of multi-chain protein
                  complexes remains a challenge in many cases. In this work, we
                  demonstrate that an AlphaFold model trained specifically for
                  multimeric inputs of known stoichiometry, which we call
                  AlphaFold-Multimer, significantly increases accuracy of

                  single-chain AlphaFold while maintaining high intra-chain
                  accuracy. On a benchmark dataset of 17 heterodimer proteins
                  without templates (introduced in [2]) we achieve at least
                  medium accuracy (DockQ [3] ≥ 0.49) on 13 targets and high
                  accuracy (DockQ ≥ 0.8) on 7 targets, compared to 9 targets of

                  4,446 recent protein complexes, from which we score all
                  non-redundant interfaces with low template identity. For
                  heteromeric interfaces we successfully predict the interface
                  (DockQ ≥ 0.23) in 70\% of cases, and produce high accuracy

                  are complicated by the multisubunit structure of RNA
                  polymerase and by its indispensability for cell growth.
                  Previously, mutant RNA polymerases have been produced by in
                  vitro assembly from isolated subunits or by in vivo assembly
                  upon overexpression of a single mutant subunit. Both
                  approaches can fail if the mutant subunit is toxic or

                  co-overexpression and in vivo assembly of RNA polymerase
                  subunits, and apply this method to characterize the role of
                  sequence insertions present in the Escherichia coli enzyme. We
                  find that co-overexpression of its subunits allows assembly of
                  an RNA polymerase lacking a 188-amino acid insertion in the
                  beta' subunit. Based on experiments with this and other mutant

  abstract     = {An essential requirement for theoretical protein structure
                  prediction is an energy function that can discriminate the
                  native from non-native protein conformations. To date most of
                  the energy functions used for this purpose have been extracted
                  from a statistical analysis of the protein structure database,
                  without explicit reference to the physical interactions
                  responsible for protein stability. The use of the statistical
                  functions has been supported by the widespread belief that
                  they are superior for such discrimination to physics-based
                  energy functions. An effective energy function which combined
                  the CHARMM vacuum potential with a Gaussian model for the
                  solvation free energy is tested for its ability to
                  discriminate the native structure of a protein from misfolded
                  conformations; the results are compared with those obtained
                  with the vacuum CHARMM potential. The test is performed on
                  several sets of misfolded structures prepared by others,
                  including sets of about 650 good decoys for six proteins, as
                  well as on misfolded structures of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2.
                  The vacuum CHARMM potential is successful in most cases when
                  energy minimized conformations are considered, but fails when
                  applied to structures relaxed by molecular dynamics. With the
                  effective energy function the native state is always more
                  stable than grossly misfolded conformations both in energy
                  minimized and molecular dynamics-relaxed structures. The
                  present results suggest that molecular mechanics
                  (physics-based) energy functions, complemented by a simple
                  model for the solvation free energy, should be tested for use
                  in the inverse folding problem, and supports their use in
                  studies of the effective energy surface of proteins in
                  solution. Moreover, the study suggests that the belief in the
                  superiority of statistical functions for these purposes may be
                  ill founded.}

  abstract     = {The state-of-the-art to assess the structural quality of
                  docking models is currently based on three related yet
                  independent quality measures: Fnat, LRMS, and iRMS as proposed
                  and standardized by CAPRI. These quality measures quantify
                  different aspects of the quality of a particular docking model
                  and need to be viewed together to reveal the true quality,
                  e.g. a model with relatively poor LRMS (>10Å) might still
                  qualify as 'acceptable' with a descent Fnat (>0.50) and iRMS
                  (<3.0Å). This is also the reason why the so called CAPRI
                  criteria for assessing the quality of docking models is
                  defined by applying various ad-hoc cutoffs on these measures
                  to classify a docking model into the four classes: Incorrect,
                  Acceptable, Medium, or High quality. This classification has
                  been useful in CAPRI, but since models are grouped in only
                  four bins it is also rather limiting, making it difficult to
                  rank models, correlate with scoring functions or use it as
                  target function in machine learning algorithms. Here, we
                  present DockQ, a continuous protein-protein docking model
                  quality measure derived by combining Fnat, LRMS, and iRMS to a
                  single score in the range [0, 1] that can be used to assess
                  the quality of protein docking models. By using DockQ on CAPRI
                  models it is possible to almost completely reproduce the
                  original CAPRI classification into Incorrect, Acceptable,
                  Medium and High quality. An average PPV of 94\% at 90\% Recall
                  demonstrating that there is no need to apply predefined ad-hoc
                  cutoffs to classify docking models. Since DockQ recapitulates
                  the CAPRI classification almost perfectly, it can be viewed as
                  a higher resolution version of the CAPRI classification,
                  making it possible to estimate model quality in a more
                  quantitative way using Z-scores or sum of top ranked models,
                  which has been so valuable for the CASP community. The
                  possibility to directly correlate a quality measure to a
                  scoring function has been crucial for the development of
                  scoring functions for protein structure prediction, and DockQ
                  should be useful in a similar development in the protein
                  docking field. DockQ is available at

                  bicistronic or multicistronic vectors, an internal ribosomal
                  entry site (IRES) has been widely used. Due to the large size
                  and difference in expression levels between genes before and
                  after IRES, however, a new strategy was required to replace
                  IRES. A self-cleaving 2A peptide could be a good candidate to
                  replace IRES because of its small size and high cleavage
                  efficiency between genes upstream and downstream of the 2A
                  peptide. Despite the advantages of the 2A peptides, its use is
                  not widespread because (i) there are no publicly available
                  cloning vectors harboring a 2A peptide gene and (ii)
                  comprehensive comparison of cleavage efficiency among various
                  2A peptides reported to date has not been performed in

                  we generated and the highest efficiency of the P2A peptide we

                  scaffolds1,2, but has been limited by a lack of suitable
                  protein structures and the complexity of native protein
                  sequence-structure relationships. Here we describe a
                  deep-learning-based 'family-wide hallucination' approach that
                  generates large numbers of idealized protein structures
                  containing diverse pocket shapes and designed sequences that
                  encode them. We use these scaffolds to design artificial
                  luciferases that selectively catalyse the oxidative
                  chemiluminescence of the synthetic luciferin substrates
                  diphenylterazine3 and 2-deoxycoelenterazine. The designed
                  active sites position an arginine guanidinium group adjacent
                  to an anion that develops during the reaction in a binding
                  pocket with high shape complementarity. For both luciferin
                  substrates, we obtain designed luciferases with high
                  selectivity; the most active of these is a small (13.9 kDa)
                  and thermostable (with a melting temperature higher than 95
                  °C) enzyme that has a catalytic efficiency on diphenylterazine
                  (kcat/Km = 106 M-1 s-1) comparable to that of native
                  luciferases, but a much higher substrate specificity. The
                  creation of highly active and specific biocatalysts from
                  scratch with broad applications in biomedicine is a key
                  milestone for computational enzyme design, and our approach

                  protein-design methodology. Nevertheless, most methods demand
                  expert intervention, limiting their widespread adoption. By
                  contrast, the PROSS algorithm for improving protein stability
                  and heterologous expression levels has been successfully
                  applied to a range of challenging enzymes and binding
                  proteins. Here, we benchmark the application of PROSS as a
                  stand-alone tool for protein scientists with no or limited
                  experience in modeling. Twelve laboratories from the Protein
                  Production and Purification Partnership in Europe (P4EU)
                  challenged the PROSS algorithm with 14 unrelated protein
                  targets without support from the PROSS developers. For each
                  target, up to six designs were evaluated for expression levels
                  and in some cases, for thermal stability and activity. In nine
                  targets, designs exhibited increased heterologous expression
                  levels either in prokaryotic and/or eukaryotic expression
                  systems under experimental conditions that were tailored for
                  each target protein. Furthermore, we observed increased
                  thermal stability in nine of ten tested targets. In two prime
                  examples, the human Stem Cell Factor (hSCF) and human
                  Cadherin-Like Domain (CLD12) from the RET receptor, the wild
                  type proteins were not expressible as soluble proteins in E.
                  coli, yet the PROSS designs exhibited high expression levels
                  in E. coli and HEK293 cells, respectively, and improved
                  thermal stability. We conclude that PROSS may improve
                  stability and expressibility in diverse cases, and that
                  improvement typically requires target-specific expression
                  conditions. This study demonstrates the strengths of
                  community-wide efforts to probe the generality of new methods
                  and recommends areas for future research to advance
                  practically useful algorithms for protein science.},

                  structural biology. Recently, approaches like alphafold have
                  achieved remarkable performance on this task by combining deep
                  learning techniques with coevolutionary data from multiple
                  sequence alignments of related protein sequences. The use of
                  coevolutionary information is critical to these models'
                  accuracy, and without it their predictive performance drops
                  considerably. In living cells, however, the 3D structure of a
                  protein is fully determined by its primary sequence and the
                  biophysical laws that cause it to fold into a low-energy
                  configuration. Thus, it should be possible to predict a
                  protein's structure from only its primary sequence by learning
                  an approximate biophysical energy function. We provide
                  evidence that alphafold has learned such an energy function,
                  and uses coevolution data to solve the global search problem
                  of finding a low-energy conformation. We demonstrate that

                  quality of candidate protein structures with state-of-the-art

                  the development of biosensors and reporters for cellular and
                  clinical applications1. However, the number of such switches
                  is limited, and reengineering them is challenging. Here we
                  show that a general class of protein-based biosensors can be
                  created by inverting the flow of information through de novo
                  designed protein switches in which the binding of a peptide
                  key triggers biological outputs of interest2. The designed
                  sensors are modular molecular devices with a closed dark state
                  and an open luminescent state; analyte binding drives the
                  switch from the closed to the open state. Because the sensor
                  is based on the thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to
                  sensor activation, only one target binding domain is required,
                  which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in
                  solution. We create biosensors that can sensitively detect the
                  anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2, the IgG1 Fc domain, the HER2
                  receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors
                  for cardiac troponin I and an anti-hepatitis B virus antibody
                  with the high sensitivity required to detect these molecules
                  clinically. Given the need for diagnostic tools to track the
                  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)3,
                  we used the approach to design sensors for the SARS-CoV-2
                  spike protein and antibodies against the membrane and
                  nucleocapsid proteins. The former, which incorporates a de
                  novo designed spike receptor binding domain (RBD) binder4, has
                  a limit of detection of 15 pM and a luminescence signal
                  50-fold higher than the background level. The modularity and
                  sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid
                  construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes, and
                  highlights the power of de novo protein design to create

                  profit from the availability of large amounts of 3D structures
                  in protein structure databases or from AlphaFold predictions.
                  Current binding site identification methods heavily rely on
                  graph neural networks (GNNs), usually designed to output
                  E(3)-equivariant predictions. Such methods turned out to be
                  very beneficial for physics-related tasks like binding energy
                  or motion trajectory prediction. However, the performance of
                  GNNs at binding site identification is still limited
                  potentially due to the lack of dedicated nodes that model
                  hidden geometric entities, such as binding pockets. In this

                  deacetylase HDAC4 is covalently modified by the

                  deacetylase activity. The ability of HDAC4 to self-aggregate
                  is a prerequisite for proper sumoylation in vivo.
                  Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) signalling,
                  which induces nuclear export, abrogates SUMO-1 modification of

                  an intact nuclear localization signal and is catalysed by the
                  nuclear pore complex (NPC) RanBP2 protein, a factor newly

                  sumoylation of HDAC4 takes place at the NPC and is coupled to

                  migration in the developing cerebral cortex involves
                  Nesprin-2, which recruits cytoplasmic dynein, kinesin, and
                  actin to the nuclear envelope (NE) in other cell types.
                  However, the relative importance of these interactions in
                  neurons has remained poorly understood. To address these
                  issues, we performed in utero electroporation into the
                  developing rat brain to interfere with Nesprin-2 function. We
                  find that an ∼100-kDa "mini" form of the ∼800-kDa Nesprin-2
                  protein, which binds dynein and kinesin, is sufficient,
                  remarkably, to support neuronal migration. In contrast to
                  dynein's role in forward nuclear migration in these cells, we

                  suggesting a novel role for the opposite-directed motor
                  proteins in regulating migration velocity. In contrast to
                  studies in fibroblasts, the actin-binding domain of Nesprin-2
                  was dispensable for neuronal migration. We find further that,
                  surprisingly, the motor proteins interact with Nesprin-2
                  through the dynein/kinesin "adaptor" BicD2, both in neurons
                  and in non-mitotic fibroblasts. Furthermore, mutation of the

                  exploits the use of multimeric protein constructs, namely,
                  polyproteins, to decrease the impact of nonspecific
                  interactions, to improve data accumulation, and to allow the
                  accommodation of benchmarking reference domains within the
                  construct. However, methods to generate such constructs are
                  either time- and labor-intensive or lack control over the
                  length or the domain sequence of the obtained construct. Here,
                  we describe an approach that addresses both of these
                  shortcomings that uses Gibson assembly (GA) to generate a
                  defined recombinant polyprotein rapidly using linker
                  sequences. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we
                  used GA to make a polyprotein composed of alternating domains
                  of I27 and TmCsp, (I27-TmCsp)3-I27)(GA), and showed the
                  mechanical fingerprint, mechanical strength, and pulling speed
                  dependence are the same as an analogous polyprotein
                  constructed using the classical approach. After this
                  benchmarking, we exploited this approach to facilitiate the
                  mechanical characterization of POTRA domain 2 of BamA from E.
                  coli (EcPOTRA2) by assembling the polyprotein
                  (I27-EcPOTRA2)3-I27(GA). We show that, as predicted from the α
                  + β topology, EcPOTRA2 domains are mechanically robust over a
                  wide range of pulling speeds. Furthermore, we identify a clear
                  correlation between mechanical robustness and brittleness for
                  a range of other α + β proteins that contain the structural
                  feature of proximal terminal β-strands in parallel geometry.
                  We thus demonstrate that the GA approach is a powerful tool,
                  as it circumvents the usual time- and labor-intensive
                  polyprotein production process and allows for rapid production
                  of new constructs for single-molecule studies. As shown for
                  EcPOTRA2, this approach allows the exploration of the
                  mechanical properties of a greater number of proteins and
                  their variants. This improves our understanding of the
                  relationship between structure and mechanical strength,
                  increasing our ability to design proteins with tailored
                  mechanical properties.},

                  cultivation media) are considered among the three main
                  elements contributing to a successful production of
                  recombinant proteins. Accordingly, one of the most common
                  hosts to produce recombinant therapeutic proteins is
                  Escherichia coli. METHODOLOGY: A comprehensive literature
                  review was performed to identify important factors affecting
                  production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli.
                  RESULTS: Escherichia coli is taken into account as the
                  easiest, quickest, and cheapest host with a fully known
                  genome. Thus, numerous modifications have been carried out on
                  Escherichia coli to optimize it as a good candidate for
                  protein expression and; as a result, several engineered
                  strains of Escherichia coli have been designed. In general;
                  host strain, vector, and cultivation parameters are recognized
                  as crucial ones determining success of recombinant protein
                  expression in Escherichia coli. In this review, the role of
                  host, vector, and culture conditions along with current pros
                  and cons of different types of these factors leading to
                  success of recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli
                  were discussed. CONCLUSION: Successful protein expression in
                  Escherichia coli necessitates a broad knowledge about
                  physicochemical properties of recombinant proteins, selection
                  among common strains of Escherichia coli and vectors, as well
                  as factors related to media including time, temperature, and

                  and microtubule organization. Furthermore, dynein plays
                  essential roles during cell division where it is implicated in
                  multiple processes including centrosome separation, chromosome
                  movements, spindle organization, spindle positioning, and
                  mitotic checkpoint silencing. How is a single motor able to
                  fulfill this large array of functions and how are these
                  activities temporally and spatially regulated? The answer lies
                  in the unique composition of the dynein motor and in the
                  interactions it makes with multiple regulatory proteins that
                  define the time and place where dynein becomes active. Here,

                  is involved in, and how its regulatory proteins act to support
                  dynein. Although dynein is highly conserved amongst eukaryotes
                  (with the exception of plants), there is significant
                  variability in the cellular processes that depend on dynein in
                  different species. In this review, we concentrate on the
                  functions of cytoplasmic dynein in mammals but will also refer
                  to data obtained in other model organisms that have

                  NMR is particularly well-suited for determining dynamic
                  features of biomolecular structures. The conventional process
                  for determining biomolecular structures from experimental NMR
                  data involves its representation as conformation-dependent
                  restraints, followed by generation of structural models guided
                  by these spatial restraints. Here we describe an alternative
                  approach: generating a distribution of realistic protein
                  conformational models using artificial intelligence-(AI-)
                  based methods and then selecting the sets of conformers that
                  best explain the experimental data. We applied this
                  conformational selection approach to redetermine the solution
                  NMR structure of the enzyme Gaussia luciferase. First, we
                  generated a diverse set of conformer models using AlphaFold2
                  (AF2) with an enhanced sampling protocol. The models that
                  best-fit NOESY and chemical shift data were then selected with
                  a Bayesian scoring metric. The resulting models include
                  features of both the published NMR structure and the standard
                  AF2 model generated without enhanced sampling. This
                  "AlphaFold-NMR" protocol also generated an alternative "open"
                  conformational state that fits nearly as well to the overall
                  NMR data but accounts for some NOESY data that is not
                  consistent with first "closed" conformational state; while
                  other NOESY data consistent with this second state are not
                  consistent with the first conformational state. The structure
                  of this "open" structural state differs from that of the
                  "closed" state primarily by the position of a thumb-shaped
                  loop between α-helices H5 and H6, revealing a cryptic surface
                  pocket. These alternative conformational states of Gluc are
                  supported by "double recall" analysis of NOESY data and AF2
                  models. Additional structural states are also indicated by
                  backbone chemical shift data indicating partially-disordered
                  conformations for the C-terminal segment. Considered as a
                  multistate ensemble, these multiple states of Gluc together
                  fit the NOESY and chemical shift data better than the
                  "restraint-based" NMR structure and provide novel insights
                  into its structure-dynamic-function relationships. This study
                  demonstrates the potential of AI-based modeling with enhanced
                  sampling to generate conformational ensembles followed by
                  conformer selection with experimental data as an alternative
                  to conventional restraint satisfaction protocols for protein
                  NMR structure determination.},

                  protein-protein interactions. Chen et al. describe the design
                  of logic gates that can regulate protein association. The
                  gates were built from small, designed proteins that all have a
                  similar structure but where one module can be designed to
                  interact specifically with another module. Using monomers and
                  covalently connected monomers as inputs and encoding
                  specificity through designed hydrogen-bond networks allowed
                  the construction of two-input or three-input gates based on
                  competitive binding. The modular control elements were used to
                  regulate the association of elements of transcription
                  machinery and split enzymes in vitro and in yeast cells.
                  Science, this issue p. 78 Controlled interaction of designed
                  protein modules builds logic gates that can control
                  association of cellular proteins. The design of modular
                  protein logic for regulating protein function at the
                  posttranscriptional level is a challenge for synthetic
                  biology. Here, we describe the design of two-input AND, OR,
                  NAND, NOR, XNOR, and NOT gates built from de novo–designed
                  proteins. These gates regulate the association of arbitrary
                  protein units ranging from split enzymes to transcriptional
                  machinery in vitro, in yeast and in primary human T cells,
                  where they control the expression of the TIM3 gene related to
                  T cell exhaustion. Designed binding interaction cooperativity,
                  confirmed by native mass spectrometry, makes the gates largely
                  insensitive to stoichiometric imbalances in the inputs, and
                  the modularity of the approach enables ready extension to
                  three-input OR, AND, and disjunctive normal form gates. The
                  modularity and cooperativity of the control elements, coupled
                  with the ability to de novo design an essentially unlimited
                  number of protein components, should enable the design of
                  sophisticated posttranslational control logic over a wide

                  engineering of novel protein functionalities. Despite recent
                  progress in computational design strategies, de novo design of
                  protein structures remains challenging, given the vast size of
                  the sequence-structure space. AlphaFold2 (AF2), a
                  state-of-the-art neural network architecture, achieved
                  remarkable accuracy in predicting protein structures from
                  amino acid sequences. This raises the question whether AF2 has
                  learned the principles of protein folding sufficiently for de
                  novo design. Here, we sought to answer this question by
                  inverting the AF2 network, using the prediction weight set and
                  a loss function to bias the generated sequences to adopt a
                  target fold. Initial design trials resulted in de novo designs
                  with an overrepresentation of hydrophobic residues on the
                  protein surface compared to their natural protein family,
                  requiring additional surface optimization. In silico
                  validation of the designs showed protein structures with the
                  correct fold, a hydrophilic surface and a densely packed
                  hydrophobic core. In vitro validation showed that 7 out of 39
                  designs were folded and stable in solution with high melting
                  temperatures. In summary, our design workflow solely based on
                  AF2 does not seem to fully capture basic principles of de novo
                  protein design, as observed in the protein surface's
                  hydrophobic vs. hydrophilic patterning. However, with minimal
                  post-design intervention, these pipelines generated viable
                  sequences as assessed experimental characterization. Thus,
                  such pipelines show the potential to contribute to solving
                  outstanding challenges in de novo protein design.},

                  polar side chains, which, somewhat surprisingly, are often

                  of synthetic signaling pathways and the induction of
                  pluripotent stem cells. However, conventional approaches are
                  often inefficient, nonstoichiometric and may limit the maximum
                  number of genes that can be simultaneously expressed. We here
                  describe a versatile approach for multiple gene delivery using
                  a single expression vector by mimicking the protein expression
                  strategy of RNA viruses. This was accomplished by first
                  expressing the genes together with TEV protease as a single
                  fusion protein, then proteolytically self-cleaving the fusion
                  protein into functional components. To demonstrate this method
                  in E. coli cells, we analyzed the translation products using
                  SDS-PAGE and showed that the fusion protein was efficiently
                  cleaved into its components, which can then be purified
                  individually or as a binding complex. To demonstrate this
                  method in mammalian cells, we designed a differential
                  localization scheme and used live cell imaging to observe the
                  distinctive subcellular targeting of the processed products.
                  We also showed that the stoichiometry of the processed
                  products was consistent and corresponded with the frequency of
                  appearance of their genes on the expression vector. In
                  summary, the efficient expression and separation of up to
                  three genes was achieved in both E. coli and mammalian cells

                  structural biology, serving as highly reliable and effective
                  methods for predicting protein structures. This article
                  explores their impact and limitations, focusing on their
                  integration into experimental pipelines and their application
                  in diverse protein classes, including membrane proteins,
                  intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), and oligomers. In
                  experimental pipelines, AF2 models help X-ray crystallography
                  in resolving the phase problem, while complementarity with
                  mass spectrometry and NMR data enhances structure
                  determination and protein flexibility prediction. Predicting
                  the structure of membrane proteins remains challenging for
                  both AF2 and RF due to difficulties in capturing
                  conformational ensembles and interactions with the membrane.
                  Improvements in incorporating membrane-specific features and
                  predicting the structural effect of mutations are crucial. For
                  intrinsically disordered proteins, AF2's confidence score
                  (pLDDT) serves as a competitive disorder predictor, but
                  integrative approaches including molecular dynamics (MD)
                  simulations or hydrophobic cluster analyses are advocated for
                  accurate dynamics representation. AF2 and RF show promising
                  results for oligomeric models, outperforming traditional
                  docking methods, with AlphaFold-Multimer showing improved
                  performance. However, some caveats remain in particular for
                  membrane proteins. Real-life examples demonstrate AF2's
                  predictive capabilities in unknown protein structures, but
                  models should be evaluated for their agreement with
                  experimental data. Furthermore, AF2 models can be used
                  complementarily with MD simulations. In this Perspective, we
                  propose a "wish list" for improving deep-learning-based
                  protein folding prediction models, including using
                  experimental data as constraints and modifying models with
                  binding partners or post-translational modifications.
                  Additionally, a meta-tool for ranking and suggesting composite

                  Despite significant progress in protein structure prediction,
                  such as AlphaFold2, challenges remain on those hard targets
                  that Alphafold2 does not often perform well due to the complex
                  folding of protein and a large number of possible
                  conformations. Here we present a modified version of the
                  AlphaFold2, called Distance-AF, which aims to improve the
                  performance of AlphaFold2 by including distance constraints as
                  input information. Distance-AF uses AlphaFold2's predicted

                  constraints between amino acids to adjust folding of the
                  protein structure until it meets the constraints. Distance-AF
                  can correct the domain orientation on challenging targets,
                  leading to more accurate structures with a lower root mean

  abstract     = {For the proper organization of the six-layered mammalian
                  neocortex it is required that neurons migrate radially from
                  their place of birth towards their designated destination. The
                  molecular machinery underlying this neuronal migration is
                  still poorly understood. The dynein-adaptor protein BICD2 is
                  associated with a spectrum of human neurological diseases,
                  including malformations of cortical development. Previous
                  studies have shown that knockdown of BICD2 interferes with
                  interkinetic nuclear migration in radial glial progenitor
                  cells, and that Bicd2-deficient mice display an altered
                  laminar organization of the cerebellum and the neocortex.
                  However, the precise in vivo role of BICD2 in neocortical
                  development remains unclear. By comparing cell-type specific
                  conditional Bicd2 knock-out mice, we found that radial
                  migration in the cortex predominantly depends on BICD2
                  function in post-mitotic neurons. Neuron-specific Bicd2 cKO
                  mice showed severely impaired radial migration of late-born
                  upper-layer neurons. BICD2 depletion in cortical neurons
                  interfered with proper Golgi organization, and neuronal
                  maturation and survival of cortical plate neurons.
                  Single-neuron labeling revealed a specific role of BICD2 in
                  bipolar locomotion. Rescue experiments with wildtype and
                  disease-related mutant BICD2 constructs revealed that a
                  point-mutation in the RAB6/RANBP2-binding-domain, associated
                  with cortical malformation in patients, fails to restore
                  proper cortical neuron migration. Together, these findings
                  demonstrate a novel, cell-intrinsic role of BICD2 in cortical
                  neuron migration in vivo and provide new insights into
                  BICD2-dependent dynein-mediated functions during cortical
                  development.},

                  decade makes us optimistic that this ambition is within reach.
                  The development of artificial enzymes containing metal
                  cofactors and noncanonical organocatalytic groups shows how
                  protein structure can be optimized to harness the reactivity

                  methods have been used to design protein catalysts for diverse
                  reactions on the basis of fundamental principles of transition
                  state stabilization. Although the activities of designed
                  catalysts have been quite low, extensive laboratory evolution
                  has been used to generate efficient enzymes. Structural
                  analysis of these systems has revealed the high degree of

                  different THs is challenging. Nanopores, single-molecule

                  However, MSAs of homologous proteins are not always available,
                  such as with orphan proteins or fast-evolving proteins like
                  antibodies, and a protein typically folds in a natural setting
                  from its primary amino acid sequence into its

                  information and MSAs should not be necessary to predict a

                  similar prediction accuracy to AlphaFold2 on recently released

                  proteins that do not belong to any functionally characterized
                  protein family and antibodies that tend to have noisy MSAs due
                  to fast evolution. Our study fills a much-encountered gap in
                  structure prediction and brings us a step closer to

                  proteins in Escherichia coli. N-terminal fusions to the first
                  47 amino acids of the LpdA (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase A)
                  protein of Neisseria meningitidis have been shown to increase

                  the alpha-peptide sequence of beta-galactosidase were
                  connected via a ribosome-binding site, and two MCSs (multiple
                  cloning sites) were located surrounding the latter, allowing
                  efficient cloning by colour selection of recombinants. The
                  vector was also improved with the addition of a C-terminal
                  polyhistidine tag, and an EKS (enterokinase recognition
                  sequence) immediately after the LpdA fusion sequence. The new
                  plasmid was employed in the expression and purification of six
                  different bacterial polypeptides. One of these recombinant

                  enterokinase protease, while the polyhistidine tail
                  successfully allowed the purification of the unfused protein

                  sequence and structure pairs by iterative denoising, guided by
                  desired sequence and structural protein attributes. We
                  designed thermostable proteins with varying amino acid
                  compositions and internal sequence repeats and cage bioactive
                  peptides, such as melittin. By averaging sequence logits
                  between diffusion trajectories with distinct structural
                  constraints, we designed multistate parent-child protein
                  triples in which the same sequence folds to different
                  supersecondary structures when intact in the parent versus
                  split into two child domains. PG design trajectories can be
                  guided by experimental sequence-activity data, providing a
                  general approach for integrated computational and experimental
                  optimization of protein function.},

                  structural studies is not trivial, and failure to handle them
                  properly is often a source of irreproducibility caused by
                  issues such as pH changes, incorporation of unexpected metals,
                  or oxidization/reduction of the metal. This protocol outlines
                  the guidelines and best practices for characterizing
                  metal-binding sites in protein structures and alerts
                  experimenters to potential pitfalls during the preparation and
                  handling of metal-containing protein samples for X-ray
                  crystallography studies. The protocol features strategies for
                  controlling the sample pH and the metal oxidation state,
                  recording X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectra, and collecting

                  learning-based model that can accurately infer protein
                  structure from sequence-may discern important features of
                  folded protein energy landscapes, defined by the diversity and
                  frequency of different conformations in the folded state.
                  Here, we test the limits of its predictive power on
                  fold-switching proteins, which assume two structures with
                  regions of distinct secondary and/or tertiary structure. Using
                  several implementations of AF2, including two published
                  enhanced sampling approaches, we generated >280,000 models of
                  93 fold-switching proteins whose experimentally determined
                  conformations were likely in AF2's training set. Combining all
                  models, AF2 predicted fold switching with a modest success
                  rate of ~25\%, indicating that it does not readily sample both
                  experimentally characterized conformations of most fold
                  switchers. Further, AF2's confidence metrics selected against
                  models consistent with experimentally determined
                  fold-switching conformations in favor of inconsistent models.
                  Accordingly, these confidence metrics-though suggested to
                  evaluate protein energetics reliably-did not discriminate
                  between low and high energy states of fold-switching proteins.
                  We then evaluated AF2's performance on seven fold-switching
                  proteins outside of its training set, generating >159,000
                  models in total. Fold switching was accurately predicted in
                  one of seven targets with moderate confidence. Further, AF2
                  demonstrated no ability to predict alternative conformations
                  of two newly discovered targets without homologs in the set of
                  93 fold switchers. These results indicate that AF2 has more to
                  learn about the underlying energetics of protein ensembles and
                  highlight the need for further developments of methods that
                  readily predict multiple protein conformations.},

                  designed to enhance the transparency of protein foundation
                  models. Our approach consists of three key components: (i) A

                  main challenges in the protein domain, based on the

                  across four key dimensions: quality, novelty, diversity, and
                  robustness; and (iii) In-depth analyses from various user

                  knowledge about biological macromolecular structures that

                  buffers in biological systems. The pH of a buffer solution
                  changes only slightly when a small amount of a strong acid or
                  bases is added to it. This is widely accepted and applied both
                  in chemical and in biological (i.e. enzyme catalysis) systems.
                  Here we show some examples – spanning from pH measurements,
                  enzyme activities, electrophoretic mobilities, antibody
                  aggregation, protein thermal stability – that demonstrate
                  additional roles of buffers. They not only set pH, but also
                  address specific ion effects, in terms of Hofmeister series,
                  when strong electrolytes are also added. From the experimental
                  data referred to some charged biological moieties it emerges
                  that different buffers, at the same nominal pH, can
                  specifically adsorb at the charged surface. Buffer specific
                  adsorption modifies several molecular and macroscopic
                  properties amongst which electrophoretic mobilities, and hence
                  effective surface charges, are particularly significant. More
                  importantly, buffers' weak electrolytes, even at low
                  concentration, are found to compete for the adsorption at the
                  charged surfaces with strong electrolytes, thus modulating

  abstract     = {Nup358 is a protein subunit of the nuclear pore complex that
                  recruits the opposing microtubule motors kinesin-1 and dynein
                  [via the dynein adaptor Bicaudal D2 (BicD2)] to the nuclear
                  envelope. This pathway is important for positioning of the
                  nucleus during the early steps of mitotic spindle assembly and
                  also essential for an important process in brain development.
                  It is unknown whether dynein and kinesin-1 interact with
                  Nup358 simultaneously or whether they compete. Here, we have
                  reconstituted and characterized a minimal complex of kinesin-1
                  light chain 2 (KLC2) and Nup358. The proteins interact through
                  a W-acidic motif in Nup358, which is highly conserved among
                  vertebrates but absent in insects. While Nup358 and KLC2 form
                  predominantly monomers, their interaction results in the
                  formation of 2:2 complexes, and the W-acidic motif is required
                  for the oligomerization. In active motor complexes, BicD2 and
                  KLC2 each form dimers. Notably, we show that the dynein
                  adaptor BicD2 and KLC2 interact simultaneously with Nup358,
                  resulting in the formation of 2:2:2 complexes. Mutation of the
                  W-acidic motif results in the formation of 1:1:1 complexes. On
                  the basis of our data, we propose that Nup358 recruits
                  simultaneously one kinesin-1 motor and one dynein motor via
                  BicD2 to the nucleus. We hypothesize that the binding sites
                  are close enough to promote direct interactions between these
                  motor recognition domains, which may be important for the
                  regulation of the motility of these opposing motors. Our data
                  provide important insights into a nuclear positioning pathway
                  that is crucial for brain development and faithful chromosome
                  segregation.},

                  Escherichia coli. Investigation of factors that affect
                  stability, growth, and induction of T7 expression strains in
                  shaking vessels led to the recognition that sporadic,
                  unintended induction of expression in complex media,
                  previously reported by others, is almost certainly caused by
                  small amounts of lactose. Glucose prevents induction by
                  lactose by well-studied mechanisms. Amino acids also inhibit
                  induction by lactose during log-phase growth, and high rates
                  of aeration inhibit induction at low lactose concentrations.
                  These observations, and metabolic balancing of pH, allowed
                  development of reliable non-inducing and auto-inducing media
                  in which batch cultures grow to high densities. Expression
                  strains grown to saturation in non-inducing media retain
                  plasmid and remain fully viable for weeks in the refrigerator,
                  making it easy to prepare many freezer stocks in parallel and
                  use working stocks for an extended period. Auto-induction
                  allows efficient screening of many clones in parallel for
                  expression and solubility, as cultures have only to be
                  inoculated and grown to saturation, and yields of target
                  protein are typically several-fold higher than obtained by
                  conventional IPTG induction. Auto-inducing media have been
                  developed for labeling proteins with selenomethionine, 15N or
                  13C, and for production of target proteins by arabinose
                  induction of T7 RNA polymerase from the pBAD promoter in

                  acid PFHxS, activate gmPpara1 in vitro, which was also
                  supported by in silico analyses. Intriguingly, a binary
                  mixture of PFOA and the non-activating PFOS produced a higher
                  activation of gmPpara1 compared to PFOA alone, suggesting that

                  Supporting the experimental data, docking and molecular
                  dynamics simulations of single and double-ligand complexes led

                  and gmPparb to model-agonists and PFAAs produced similar

                  summary A major current challenge in protein design is the de
                  novo creation of selective and high-affinity
                  small-molecule–binding proteins. One promising concept is a
                  small domain that could be incorporated into other
                  applications with ease. An et al. designed small, pseudocyclic
                  peptides with a central cavity that can be expanded or reduced
                  by changing the number of repeating units to match the size of
                  a target ligand. High-throughput screening and computational
                  resampling enabled the creation of second-generation binders
                  with substantially higher affinities for four example target
                  molecules. The authors demonstrate two applications of such
                  binders that rely on incorporating them as a domain into a
                  larger, de novo–designed protein: a nanopore fusion for
                  small-molecule sensing and a split protein for chemically

                  proteins (TMP) for molecular biology and medicine,
                  experimental 3D structures for TMPs remain about 4-5 times
                  underrepresented compared to non-TMPs. Today's top methods
                  such as AlphaFold2 accurately predict 3D structures for many
                  TMPs, but annotating transmembrane regions remains a limiting
                  step for proteome-wide predictions. RESULTS: Here, we present
                  TMbed, a novel method inputting embeddings from protein
                  Language Models (pLMs, here ProtT5), to predict for each
                  residue one of four classes: transmembrane helix (TMH),
                  transmembrane strand (TMB), signal peptide, or other. TMbed
                  completes predictions for entire proteomes within hours on a
                  single consumer-grade desktop machine at performance levels
                  similar or better than methods, which are using evolutionary
                  information from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of
                  protein families. On the per-protein level, TMbed correctly
                  identified 94 ± 8\% of the beta barrel TMPs (53 of 57) and 98
                  ± 1\% of the alpha helical TMPs (557 of 571) in a
                  non-redundant data set, at false positive rates well below 1\%
                  (erred on 30 of 5654 non-membrane proteins). On the
                  per-segment level, TMbed correctly placed, on average, 9 of 10
                  transmembrane segments within five residues of the

                  Viterbi), TMbed predicts alpha helical and beta barrel TMPs at
                  least as accurately as any other method but at lower false
                  positive rates. Given the few false positives and its
                  outstanding speed, TMbed might be ideal to sieve through
                  millions of 3D structures soon to be predicted, e.g., by
                  AlphaFold2.},

                  cultured cells showed that the encephalomyocarditis virus IRES
                  provided the most efficient means for coexpressing two genes
                  from a single provirus. Most importantly, most cells infected
                  by a LacZ-IRES-CAT virus expressed both LacZ and CAT, whereas
                  most cells infected by internal promoter or regulated splicing
                  vectors expressed either LacZ or CAT but not both. In
                  addition, viral titers were highest with IRES vectors.
                  Presumably, use of the IRES avoids transcriptional controls
                  and RNA processing steps that differentially affect expression
                  of multiple genes from internal promoter and regulated
                  splicing vectors. Finally, we injected a LacZ-IRES-v-Src virus
                  into chicken embryos and then identified the progeny of
                  infected cells with a histochemical stain for LacZ.
                  LacZ-positive cells in both skin and mesenchyme displayed
                  morphological abnormalities attributable to expression of
                  v-src. Thus, IRES vectors can be used to coexpress a reporter
                  gene and a bioactive gene in vivo.}

                  ProteinGenerator, a sequence space diffusion model based on
                  RoseTTAfold that simultaneously generates protein sequences
                  and structures. Beginning from random amino acid sequences,
                  our model generates sequence and structure pairs by iterative
                  denoising, guided by any desired sequence and structural
                  protein attributes. To explore the versatility of this
                  approach, we designed proteins enriched for specific amino
                  acids, with internal sequence repeats, with masked bioactive
                  peptides, with state dependent structures, and with key

                  ProteinGenerator readily generates sequence-structure pairs

                  criteria, and experimental validation showed that the designs

                  the cryo-EM 3D structure of the human Bact spliceosome at 3.4
                  Å resolution. In the Bact state, the spliceosome is activated
                  but not catalytically primed, so that it is functionally
                  blocked prior to the first catalytic step of splicing. The
                  spliceosomal core is similar to the yeast Bact spliceosome;
                  important differences include the presence of the RNA helicase
                  aquarius and peptidyl prolyl isomerases. To examine the
                  overall dynamic behavior of the purified spliceosome, we
                  developed a principal component analysis-based approach.
                  Calculating the energy landscape revealed eight major
                  conformational states, which we refined to higher resolution.
                  Conformational differences of the highly flexible structural
                  components between these eight states reveal how spliceosomal
                  components contribute to the assembly of the spliceosome,

  abstract     = {Molecular dynamics simulations of lipid membranes have become
                  increasingly impactful in biophysics because they offer
                  atomistic resolution of structural fluctuations in relation to
                  their functional outputs. Yet quantitative characterization of
                  multiscale processes is a formidable challenge due to the
                  distribution of motions that evade analysis of discrete
                  simulation data. Here we investigate the efficient calculation
                  of CH bond relaxation rates from membrane simulations. Widely
                  used computational approaches offer numerical simplicity but
                  fall short of capturing crucial aspects of the orientation
                  dependence of the dynamics. To circumvent this problem, we
                  introduced a robust framework based on liquid crystal theory
                  which considers explicitly the CH bond motions with respect to
                  the director axis (bilayer normal). Analysis of the
                  orientation dependence of the dynamics shows excellent
                  agreement with experiment, illustrating how the ordering
                  potential affects the calculated relaxation rates.
                  Furthermore, a fit-based resampling of the autocorrelation
                  function of the bond fluctuations validates the new approach
                  for low-temporal resolution data. The recovered relaxation
                  rates indicate that at short timescales, both with and without
                  cholesterol, the local motions of CH bonds describe the
                  bilayer microviscosity and resemble liquid hydrocarbons. Our
                  results establish the critical role of the orientational
                  anisotropy in analysis of membrane simulations, explain
                  fundamental aspects of lipid dynamics, and provide guidelines
                  for extracting information that can be compared to

                  evidence that tags may perturb the condensation properties of

                  protein tags on the yeast DEAD-box ATPase Dhh1, a central
                  regulator of processing bodies (P-bodies), which are
                  biomolecular condensates involved in mRNA metabolism. We show

                  their polycistronic nature, small size and high "cleavage"
                  efficiency. However, broad application of 2 A peptides is
                  limited by the lack of systematic comparison of different 2As

                  missense variations reported in any of these 26 genes. More
                  than a thousand missense variants were collected from ClinVar
                  and the targeted screen of a breast cancer cohort of 355
                  patients which contributed to this set with 160 novel missense
                  variations. We analyzed the impact of the missense variations
                  on protein stability by five different predictors including
                  both sequence- (SAAF2EC and MUpro) and structure-based
                  (Maestro, mCSM, CUPSAT) predictors. For the structure-based
                  tools, we have utilized the AlphaFold (AF2) protein structures
                  which comprise the first structural analysis of this
                  hereditary cancer proteins. Our results agreed with the recent
                  benchmarks that computed the power of stability predictors in
                  discriminating the pathogenic variants. Overall, we reported a
                  low-to-medium-level performance for the stability predictors
                  in discriminating pathogenic variants, except MUpro which had
                  an AUROC of 0.534 (95\% CI [0.499-0.570]). The AUROC values
                  ranged between 0.614-0.719 for the total set and 0.596-0.682
                  for the set with high AF2 confidence regions. Furthermore, our
                  findings revealed that the confidence score for a given
                  variant in the AF2 structure could alone predict pathogenicity
                  more robustly than any of the tested stability predictors with
                  an AUROC of 0.852. Altogether, this study represents the first
                  structural analysis of the 26 hereditary cancer genes
                  underscoring 1) the thermodynamic stability predicted from AF2
                  structures as a moderate and 2) the confidence score of AF2 as
                  a strong descriptor for variant pathogenicity.},

                  for thein silicodesign of novel proteins. Recently, a family
                  of generative models called diffusion models has demonstrated
                  the ability to generate biologically plausible proteins that
                  are dissimilar to any actual proteins seen in nature, enabling
                  unprecedented capability and control inde novoprotein design.
                  However, current state-of-the-art diffusion models generate
                  protein structures, which limits the scope of their training
                  data and restricts generations to a small and biased subset of
                  protein design space. Here, we introduce a general-purpose
                  diffusion framework, EvoDiff, that combines evolutionary-scale
                  data with the distinct conditioning capabilities of diffusion
                  models for controllable protein generation in sequence space.
                  EvoDiff generates high-fidelity, diverse, and
                  structurally-plausible proteins that cover natural sequence
                  and functional space. We show experimentally that EvoDiff
                  generations express, fold, and exhibit expected secondary
                  structure elements. Critically, EvoDiff can generate proteins
                  inaccessible to structure-based models, such as those with
                  disordered regions, while maintaining the ability to design
                  scaffolds for functional structural motifs. We validate the
                  universality of our sequence-based formulation by
                  experimentally characterizing intrinsically-disordered
                  mitochondrial targeting signals, metal-binding proteins, and
                  protein binders designed using EvoDiff. We envision that
                  EvoDiff will expand capabilities in protein engineering beyond
                  the structure-function paradigm toward programmable,
                  sequence-first design.}

                  report that ALREX-promoting elements also potentiate
                  translation in the presence of upstream nuclear factors. These

                  with, the zinc finger repeats of RanBP2/Nup358, which is
                  present on the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore. Finally
                  we show that RanBP2/Nup358 is not only required for the
                  stimulation of translation by ALREX-promoting elements, but is

                  At the end of a three-enzyme cascade, E3 ubiquitin ligases
                  (E3s) recruit substrates and promote or directly catalyze
                  ubiquitin transfer to targets. These enzymes largely determine
                  the specificity of the ubiquitination reaction. Genetic
                  alteration, abnormal expression, or dysfunction of E3s account
                  for the occurrence and progression of human cancers. Indeed,
                  excessive degradation of relevant tumor-suppressor molecules
                  and impaired disposal of oncogenic proteins have been linked
                  to tumorigenesis. This review focuses on the emerging roles of
                  HECT-type E3s in tumorigenesis, and emphasizes how

                  energy is developed. It is based on theoretical considerations
                  and parametrized with experimental data. When combined with
                  the CHARMM 19 polar hydrogen energy function, it provides an
                  effective energy function (EEF1) for proteins in solution. The
                  solvation model assumes that the solvation free energy of a
                  protein molecule is a sum of group contributions, which are
                  determined from values for small model compounds. For charged
                  groups, the self‐energy contribution is accounted for
                  primarily by the exclusion model. Ionic side‐chains are
                  neutralized, and a distance‐dependent dielectric constant is
                  used to approximate the charge–charge interactions in
                  solution. The resulting EEF1 is subjected to a number of
                  tests. Molecular dynamics simulations at room temperature of
                  several proteins in their native conformation are performed,
                  and stable trajectories are obtained. The deviations from the
                  experimental structures are similar to those observed in
                  explicit water simulations. The calculated enthalpy of
                  unfolding of a polyalanine helix is found to be in good
                  agreement with experimental data. Results reported elsewhere
                  show that EEF1 clearly distinguishes correctly from
                  incorrectly folded proteins, both in static energy evaluations
                  and in molecular dynamics simulations and that unfolding
                  pathways obtained by high‐temperature molecular dynamics
                  simulations agree with those obtained by explicit water
                  simulations. Thus, this energy function appears to provide a
                  realistic first approximation to the effective energy

                  produced an image of biology encoded into the space of natural
                  proteins. Here we show that language models trained on tokens
                  generated by evolution can act as evolutionary simulators to
                  generate functional proteins that are far away from known
                  proteins. We present ESM3, a frontier multimodal generative
                  language model that reasons over the sequence, structure, and
                  function of proteins. ESM3 can follow complex prompts
                  combining its modalities and is highly responsive to
                  biological alignment. We have prompted ESM3 to generate
                  fluorescent proteins with a chain of thought. Among the
                  generations that we synthesized, we found a bright fluorescent
                  protein at far distance (58\% identity) from known fluorescent
                  proteins. Similarly distant natural fluorescent proteins are
                  separated by over five hundred million years of evolution.}

                  unfavourable non-ideal features--for example kinked α-helices,
                  bulged β-strands, strained loops and buried polar groups--that
                  arise in proteins from evolutionary selection for biological

                  to designing ideal protein structures stabilized by completely
                  consistent local and non-local interactions. The approach is
                  based on a set of rules relating secondary structure patterns
                  to protein tertiary motifs, which make possible the design of
                  funnel-shaped protein folding energy landscapes leading into
                  the target folded state. Guided by these rules, we designed
                  sequences predicted to fold into ideal protein structures
                  consisting of α-helices, β-strands and minimal loops. Designs

                  identical to the computational models. These results
                  illuminate how the folding funnels of natural proteins arise

                  similarity measures based on a global superposition of carbon
                  α atoms are strongly influenced by domain motions and do not
                  assess the accuracy of local atomic details in the model.
                  Results: The Local Distance Difference Test (lDDT) is a
                  superposition-free score that evaluates local distance
                  differences of all atoms in a model, including validation of
                  stereochemical plausibility. The reference can be a single
                  structure, or an ensemble of equivalent structures. We
                  demonstrate that lDDT is well suited to assess local model
                  quality, even in the presence of domain movements, while
                  maintaining good correlation with global measures. These

                  of possible binding modes to a selected region of a protein

                  applicability of this approach through the de novo design of
                  binding proteins to 12 diverse protein targets with different
                  shapes and surface properties. Biophysical characterization

                  double-helical nature of DNA revealed essential aspects of how
                  genetic information is stored, copied and repaired. Yet, being
                  reductionist in nature, structural biology requires the
                  purification of large amounts of macromolecules, often trimmed
                  off larger functional units. The advent of cryogenic electron
                  microscopy (cryo-EM) greatly facilitated the study of large,
                  functional complexes and generally of samples that are hard to
                  express, purify and/or crystallize. Nevertheless, cryo-EM
                  still requires purification and thus visualization outside of
                  the natural context in which macromolecules operate and
                  coexist. Conversely, cell biologists have been imaging cells

                  structural and cell biology provide complementary, yet
                  unconnected visions of the inner workings of cells. Here we

  abstract     = {The structure, function, and evolution of proteins depend on
                  physical and genetic interactions among amino acids. Recent
                  studies have used new strategies to explore the prevalence,
                  biochemical mechanisms, and evolutionary implications of these
                  interactions-called epistasis-within proteins. Here we
                  describe an emerging picture of pervasive epistasis in which
                  the physical and biological effects of mutations change over
                  the course of evolution in a lineage-specific fashion.
                  Epistasis can restrict the trajectories available to an
                  evolving protein or open new paths to sequences and functions
                  that would otherwise have been inaccessible. We describe two
                  broad classes of epistatic interactions, which arise from
                  different physical mechanisms and have different effects on
                  evolutionary processes. Specific epistasis-in which one
                  mutation influences the phenotypic effect of few other
                  mutations-is caused by direct and indirect physical
                  interactions between mutations, which nonadditively change the
                  protein's physical properties, such as conformation,
                  stability, or affinity for ligands. In contrast, nonspecific
                  epistasis describes mutations that modify the effect of many
                  others; these typically behave additively with respect to the
                  physical properties of a protein but exhibit epistasis because
                  of a nonlinear relationship between the physical properties
                  and their biological effects, such as function or fitness.
                  Both types of interaction are rampant, but specific epistasis
                  has stronger effects on the rate and outcomes of evolution,
                  because it imposes stricter constraints and modulates
                  evolutionary potential more dramatically; it therefore makes
                  evolution more contingent on low-probability historical events
                  and leaves stronger marks on the sequences, structures, and
                  functions of protein families.},

                  Protein PTMs have also emerged as reliable biomarkers for
                  several diseases. However, only a handful of techniques are
                  available to accurately measure their levels, capture their
                  complexity at a single molecule level, and characterize their
                  multifaceted roles in health and disease. Nanopore sensing
                  provides high sensitivity for the detection of low-abundance
                  proteins, holding the potential to impact single-molecule
                  proteomics and PTM detection, in particular. Here, we

                  to reveal the role of the shape complementarity in the
                  protein-protein interactions, i.e., when the two proteins with
                  shape complementarity approach each other, the conformation of
                  lipid chains between two proteins would be restricted
                  significantly. The lipid molecules tend to leave the gap
                  formed by two proteins to maximize the configuration entropy,
                  and therefore yield an effective entropy-induced
                  protein-protein attraction, which enhances the protein

                  that play an important role in several neurodegenerative and
                  systemic diseases. Although structural information of the
                  amyloid state is now abundant, mechanistic details about the
                  misfolding process remain elusive. Inspired by the Φ-value
                  analysis of protein folding, we combined experiments and
                  molecular simulations to resolve amino-acid contacts and
                  determine the structure of the transition-state ensemble—the
                  rate-limiting step—for fibril elongation of PI3K-SH3 amyloid
                  fibrils. The ensemble was validated experimentally by Tanford
                  β analysis and computationally by free energy calculations.
                  Although protein folding proceeds on funnel-shaped landscapes,
                  here we find that the energy landscape for the misfolding
                  reaction consists of a large ‘golf course’ region, defined by
                  a single energy barrier and transition state, accessing a
                  sharply funnelled region. Thus, misfolding occurs by rare,
                  successful monomer–fibril end collisions interspersed by
                  numerous unsuccessful binding attempts. Taken together, these
                  insights provide a quantitative and highly resolved
                  description of a protein misfolding reaction. Amyloid fibrils
                  grow through the recruitment of soluble monomer to the fibril
                  end that propagates the fibril structure. Here the transition
                  state, the rate-limiting conformation, of such a reaction has
                  been characterized by Φ-value analysis. An energy landscape

                  coil geometry has been widely useful for guiding design of new
                  protein structures and functions. However, design guided by
                  similar global parameterization of beta barrel structures has
                  been less successful, likely due to the deviations from ideal
                  barrel geometry required to maintain inter-strand hydrogen
                  bonding without introducing backbone strain. Instead, beta
                  barrels have been designed using 2D structural blueprints;
                  while this approach has successfully generated new fluorescent
                  proteins, transmembrane nanopores, and other structures, it
                  requires expert knowledge and provides only indirect control
                  over the global shape. Here we show that the simplicity and
                  control over shape and structure provided by parametric
                  representations can be generalized beyond coiled coils by
                  taking advantage of the rich sequence-structure relationships

                  with conductances ranging from 200 to 500 pS. By combining the
                  simplicity and control of parametric generation with the high
                  success rates of deep learning based protein design methods,
                  our approach makes the design of proteins where global shape
                  confers function, such as beta barrel nanopores, more
                  precisely specifiable and accessible. Significance De novo
                  beta barrel proteins have previously been designed using
                  “blueprint” based methods which require expert knowledge of
                  the rules of folding and provide only indirect control of the
                  overall barrel shape by specifying structural features such as
                  glycine kinks and beta bulges. The barrel shape can be
                  directly modeled using global parametric methods, but to date
                  such methods have not succeeded in generating folded proteins,
                  likely due to the absence of such structural features. Here,
                  we describe methods that combine the simplicity and control of
                  parametric barrel specification with the high success rates of
                  deep learning based protein design methods to successfully
                  design new beta barrel folds of different and pre-specified
                  sizes, including both soluble designs and transmembrane
                  nanopores.}

                  the dynamical mechanisms of proteins that implement biological
                  function remains an outstanding scientific challenge. Several
                  experimental techniques and molecular dynamics (MD)
                  simulations can, in principle, determine conformational
                  states, binding configurations and their probabilities, but
                  suffer from low throughput. Here we develop a Biomolecular
                  Emulator (BioEmu), a generative deep learning system that can
                  generate thousands of statistically independent samples from
                  the protein structure ensemble per hour on a single graphical
                  processing unit. By leveraging novel training methods and vast
                  data of protein structures, over 200 milliseconds of MD
                  simulation, and experimental protein stabilities, BioEmu's
                  protein ensembles represent equilibrium in a range of
                  challenging and practically relevant metrics. Qualitatively,
                  BioEmu samples many functionally relevant conformational
                  changes, ranging from formation of cryptic pockets, over
                  unfolding of specific protein regions, to large-scale domain
                  rearrangements. Quantitatively, BioEmu samples protein
                  conformations with relative free energy errors around 1
                  kcal/mol, as validated against millisecond-timescale MD

                  simultaneously emulating structural ensembles and
                  thermodynamic properties, BioEmu reveals mechanistic insights,
                  such as the causes for fold destabilization of mutants, and
                  can efficiently provide experimentally-testable hypotheses.},

                  irregular tertiary structures of most globular proteins, and
                  have fascinated structural biologists since they were first
                  discovered. Simple parametric models have been used to design
                  a wide range of α-helical coiled-coil structures, but to date
                  there has been no success with β-barrels. Here we show that

                  symmetry-breaking to achieve continuous hydrogen-bond

                  ensembles of β-barrel backbone models with cavity shapes that
                  match the fluorogenic compound DFHBI, and use a hierarchical

                  function, with its capability to perform differentiable

  abstract     = {AbstractMitochondrial networks exhibit remarkable dynamics
                  that are driven in part by fission and fusion events. However,
                  there are other reorganizations of the network that do not
                  involve fission and fusion. One such exception is the elusive,
                  “beads-on-a-string” morphological transition of mitochondria.
                  During such transitions, the cylindrical tubes of the
                  mitochondrial membrane transiently undergo shape changes to a
                  string of “pearls” connected along thin tubes. These dynamics
                  have been anecdotally observed in many contexts and given
                  disparate explanations. Here we unify these observations by
                  proposing a common underlying mechanism based on the
                  biophysical properties of tubular fluid membranes for which it
                  is known that, under particular regimes of tension and
                  pressure, membranes reach an instability and undergo a shape
                  transition to a string of connected pearls. First, we use
                  high-speed light-sheet microscopy to show that transient,
                  short-lived pearling events occur spontaneously in the
                  mitochondrial network in every cell type we have examined,
                  including primary fibroblasts, T-cells, neurons, and budding
                  yeast. We present evidence that transient mitochondrial
                  pearling occurs during important biological events,
                  particularly during T cell activation and neuronal firing.
                  Using our high-temporal resolution data, we identify two
                  distinct categories of spontaneous pearling, i) internal
                  pressure-driven pearling regulated by ionic flux, and ii)
                  external tension-driven pearling regulated by molecular
                  motors. By applying live-cell STED microscopy we document the
                  structural reorganization of inner cristae membranes during
                  mitochondrial pearling. We then compare numerous methods for
                  inducing pearling, including the ability to induce these
                  dynamics with single mitochondrion precision. These methods
                  include ionophores, channel activators, osmotic shock,
                  detergents, laser stimulation, membrane intercalating
                  molecules, chemical fixation, and micro-needle force. These
                  disparate inducers establish three main physical causes of
                  pearling, i) ionic flux amplifying internal osmotic pressure,
                  ii) membrane packing lowering bending elasticity, and iii)
                  external mechanical force increasing membrane tension.
                  Pearling dynamics thereby reveal a fundamental biophysical
                  facet of mitochondrial biology. We suggest that pearling
                  should take its place beside fission and fusion as a key
                  process of mitochondrial dynamics, with implications for
                  physiology, disease, and aging.},

  abstract     = {The analysis of single-copy core genes, common to most members
                  of a clade, is important for key tasks in biology including
                  phylogenetic reconstruction and assessing genome quality. Core
                  genes are traditionally identified by the analysis of amino
                  acid similarities among proteomes, but can also be defined
                  using structures, which bear potential in deep clades beyond
                  the twilight zone of amino acids. Despite breakthroughs in
                  accurate AI-driven protein structure prediction, obtaining
                  full 3D structural models on a proteomic scale is still
                  prohibitively slow. Here, we present Unicore, a novel method
                  for identifying structural core genes at a scale suitable for
                  downstream phylogenetic analysis. By applying the ProstT5
                  protein language model to the input proteomes to obtain their
                  3Di structural strings, Unicore saves over three orders of
                  magnitude in runtime compared to a full 3D prediction. Using
                  Foldseek clustering, Unicore identifies single-copy structures
                  universally present in the species and aligns them using
                  Foldmason. These structural core gene alignments are projected
                  back to amino acid information for downstream phylogenetic
                  analysis. We demonstrate that this approach defines core genes
                  with linear run-time scaling over the number of species, up to
                  56 times faster than OrthoFinder, while reconstructing
                  phylogenetic relationships congruent with conventional
                  approaches. Unicore is universally applicable to any given set
                  of taxa, even spanning superkingdoms and overcoming
                  limitations of previous methods requiring orthologs of fixed
                  taxonomic scope, and is available as a free and open source

                  protein-ligand interactions is critical for elucidating the
                  binding mechanisms that govern these interactions. Traditional
                  methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are
                  computationally intensive, leading to a demand for more
                  efficient approaches. This study explores how multiple
                  sequence alignment (MSA) clustering enhance AF-Multimer's
                  ability to predict conformational landscapes, particularly for
                  proteins with multiple conformational states. Results: We
                  verified this approach by predicting the conformational
                  landscapes of chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and glucagon
                  receptor (GCGR) in the presence of their agonists and
                  antagonists. In our experiments, AF-Multimer predicted the
                  structures of CXCR4 and GCGR predominantly in active state in
                  the presence of agonists and in inactive state in the presence
                  of antagonists. Moreover, we tested our approach with proteins
                  known to switch between monomeric and dimeric states, such as
                  lymphotactin, SH3, and thermonuclease. AFcluster-Multimer
                  accurately predicted conformational states during
                  oligomerization, which AFcluster with AlphaFold2 alone fails
                  to achieve. In conclusion, MSA clustering enhances
                  AF-Multimer's ability to predict protein conformational
                  landscapes and mechanistic effects of ligand binding, offering
                  a robust tool for understanding protein-ligand interactions.

                  engage in essential molecular functions, yet they are often

                  understand the seeming paradox of how sequence variability is
                  compatible with persistent function, we examined the
                  functional determinants for a poorly conserved but essential
                  IDR. We show that IDR function depends on two distinct but
                  related properties: sequence- and chemical specificity. While
                  sequence-specificity works via linear binding motifs, chemical
                  specificity reflects the sequence-encoded chemistry of
                  multivalent interactions through amino acids across an IDR.
                  Unexpectedly, a binding motif that is essential in the
                  wild-type IDR can be removed if compensatory changes to the
                  sequence chemistry are made, highlighting the orthogonality
                  and interoperability of both properties and providing a much
                  deeper sequence space compatible with function. Our results

                  in numerous signaling pathways and important drug targets for
                  several diseases. A major shortcoming in GPCR ligand screening
                  is the detection limit for weak binding molecules, which is
                  especially critical for poorly druggable GPCRs. Here, we
                  present a proximity-based screening system for class A GPCRs,
                  which adopts the natural two-step activation mechanism of
                  class B GPCRs. In this approach, class A/B chimeras with the
                  extracellular domain of the class B receptor CRF1R grafted to
                  the transmembrane domain of target class A receptors are
                  stimulated with hybrid ligands. These ligands contain a
                  high-affinity peptide derived from CRF, which recruits the
                  hybrid ligands to the engineered target GPCR, dramatically
                  increasing the local concentration of the test substances. We
                  exemplified this method for neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) and

                  enabling the detection of weakly activating sequences that

                  disordered protein complexes are truly independent of chiral
                  constraints is not clear. Here, to investigate the chiral
                  constraints of disordered protein-protein interactions, we
                  chose as representative examples a set of five interacting
                  protein pairs covering the disorder-order continuum. By
                  observing the natural ligands and their stereochemical mirror

                  folding and binding, correct stereochemistry was essential.
                  Between these extremes, binding could be observed for the

                  continuous 3D coordinates; this limits the space of possible
                  architectures and may lead to suboptimal performance. In
                  response, we propose an antibody sequence-structure decoupling
                  (ASSD) framework, which separates sequence generation and
                  structure prediction. Although our approach is simple, our
                  idea allows the use of powerful neural architectures and
                  demonstrates notable performance improvements. We also find
                  that the widely used non-autoregressive generators promote
                  sequences with overly repeating tokens. Such sequences are
                  both out-of-distribution and prone to undesirable
                  developability properties that can trigger harmful immune
                  responses in patients. To resolve this, we introduce a
                  composition-based objective that allows an efficient trade-off
                  between high performance and low token repetition. ASSD shows
                  improved performance in various antibody design experiments,
                  while the composition-based objective successfully mitigates
                  token repetition of non-autoregressive models.},

                  performance in many areas of machine learning and generative
                  modeling. While the fundamental ideas behind these models come
                  from non-equilibrium physics, variational inference and
                  stochastic calculus, in this paper we show that many aspects
                  of these models can be understood using the tools of
                  equilibrium statistical mechanics. Using this reformulation,
                  we show that generative diffusion models undergo second-order
                  phase transitions corresponding to symmetry breaking
                  phenomena. We show that these phase-transitions are always in
                  a mean-field universality class, as they are the result of a
                  self-consistency condition in the generative dynamics. We
                  argue that the critical instability that arises from the phase
                  transitions lies at the heart of their generative
                  capabilities, which are characterized by a set of mean-field
                  critical exponents. Finally, we show that the dynamic equation
                  of the generative process can be interpreted as a stochastic
                  adiabatic transformation that minimizes the free energy while

                  characterizing transmembrane assembly remains challenging for
                  experiments and simulations. Equilibrium molecular dynamics
                  simulations do not cover the time scales required to sample
                  the typical transmembrane assembly. Hence, most studies rely
                  on enhanced sampling schemes that steer the dynamics of
                  transmembrane proteins along a collective variable that should
                  encode all slow degrees of freedom. However, given the
                  complexity of the condensed-phase lipid environment, this is
                  far from trivial, with the consequence that free energy
                  profiles of dimerization can be poorly converged. Here, we
                  introduce an alternative approach, which relies only on
                  simulating short, dynamically unbiased paths, avoiding using
                  collective variables or biasing forces. By merging all paths,
                  we obtain free energy profiles, rates, and mechanisms of

                  including medicine, environmental monitoring and defence.
                  Stochastic sensing is an approach that relies on the
                  observation of individual binding events between analyte
                  molecules and a single receptor. Engineered transmembrane
                  protein pores are promising sensor elements for stochastic
                  detection, and in their simplest manifestation they produce a
                  fluctuating binary ('on/off') response in the transmembrane
                  electrical current. The frequency of occurrence of the
                  fluctuations reveals the concentration of the analyte, and its
                  identity can be deduced from the characteristic magnitude
                  and/or duration of the fluctuations. Genetically engineered
                  versions of the bacterial pore-forming protein
                  alpha-haemolysin have been used to identify and quantify
                  divalent metal ions in solution. But it is not immediately
                  obvious how versatile binding sites for organic ligands might
                  be obtained by engineering of the pore structure. Here we show
                  that stochastic sensing of organic molecules can be procured
                  from alpha-haemolysin by equipping the channel with an
                  internal, non-covalently bound molecular 'adapter' which
                  mediates channel blocking by the analyte. We use cyclodextrins
                  as the adapters because these fit comfortably inside the pore
                  and present a hydrophobic cavity suitable for binding a
                  variety of organic analytes. Moreover, a single sensing
                  element of this sort can be used to analyse a mixture of
                  organic molecules with different binding characteristics. We
                  envisage the use of other adapters, so that the pore could be
                  'programmed' for a range of sensing functions.},

                  molecule systems is an outstanding challenge. We reasoned that
                  while residue level descriptions of biomolecules are efficient
                  for de novo structure prediction, for probing heterogeneity of
                  interactions with small molecules in the folded state an
                  entirely atomic level description could have advantages in
                  speed and generality. We developed a graph neural network
                  called ChemNet trained to recapitulate correct atomic
                  positions from partially corrupted input structures from the
                  Cambridge Structural Database and the Protein Data Bank; the
                  nodes of the graph are the atoms in the system. ChemNet
                  accurately generates structures of diverse organic small
                  molecules given knowledge of their atom composition and
                  bonding, and given a description of the larger protein
                  context, and builds up structures of small molecules and
                  protein side chains for protein-small molecule docking.
                  Because ChemNet is rapid and stochastic, ensembles of
                  predictions can be readily generated to map conformational
                  heterogeneity. In enzyme design efforts described here and
                  elsewhere, we find that using ChemNet to assess the accuracy
                  and pre-organization of the designed active sites results in
                  higher success rates and higher activities; we obtain a
                  preorganized retroaldolase with a k cat/K M of 11000 M-1min-1,
                  considerably higher than any pre-deep learning design for this
                  reaction. We anticipate that ChemNet will be widely useful for
                  rapidly generating conformational ensembles of small molecule
                  and small molecule-protein systems, and for designing higher
                  activity preorganized enzymes.},

                  site1–7, but there are a few current limitations. First, the
                  catalytic efficiencies achieved by such efforts have generally
                  been quite low, and considerable optimization by directed
                  evolution has been required to reach activities typical of
                  native enzymes.8–10Second, generative AI methods such as
                  RFdiffusion11,12now enable the direct generation of proteins
                  around active sites, but to date, such scaffolding has
                  required specification of both the position in the sequence
                  and the backbone coordinates of the catalytic residue, which
                  complicates sampling. Here we introduce a generative AI method
                  called RFam that overcomes these limitations and use it to
                  design zinc metallohydrolases starting from a density

                  contraction. To perform these various functions, VGCCs are
                  highly regulated. Inactivation comprises a critical mechanism
                  controlling the entry of Ca2+ through these channels and
                  constitutes an important means to regulate cellular
                  excitability, shape action potentials, control intracellular
                  Ca2+ levels, and contribute to long-term potentiation and
                  depression. For CaV1 and CaV2 channel families, inactivation
                  proceeds via two distinct processes. Voltage-dependent
                  inactivation (VDI) reduces Ca2+ entry through the channel in

                  response to trophic hormone stimulation of steroidogenic cells
                  has been a subject of intensive investigation for
                  approximately six decades. A key observation made very early
                  was that acute regulation of steroid biosynthesis required
                  swift and timely synthesis of a new protein whose role
                  appeared to be involved in the delivery of the substrate for
                  all steroid hormones, cholesterol, from the outer to the inner
                  mitochondrial membrane where the process of steroidogenesis
                  begins. It was quickly learned that this transfer of
                  cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane was the
                  regulated and rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis. Following
                  this observation, the quest for this putative regulator
                  protein(s) began in earnest in the late 1950s. This review
                  provides a history of this quest, the candidate proteins that
                  arose over the years and facts surrounding their rise or
                  decline. Only two have persisted-translocator protein (TSPO)
                  and the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). We
                  present a detailed summary of the work that has been published
                  for each of these two proteins, the specific data that has
                  appeared in support of their role in cholesterol transport and
                  steroidogenesis, and the ensuing observations that have arisen
                  in recent years that have refuted the role of TSPO in this
                  process. We believe that the only viable candidate that has
                  been shown to be indispensable is the StAR protein. Lastly, we
                  provide our view on what may be the most important questions
                  concerning the acute regulation of steroidogenesis that need

                  the shape matching of binder to target has not yet reached
                  that of highly evolved native protein-protein complexes, and
                  previous design efforts have failed for hard targets such as
                  the TNF receptor (TNFR1) that have relatively flat and polar
                  surfaces. We reasoned that free diffusion starting from random
                  noise could enable generation of extensive shape-matching
                  binders to challenging targets, and tested this approach on
                  TNFR1 and related super family members. The diffused TNFR1
                  binders have nanomolar affinities that increase to
                  single-digit picomolar upon refinement by partial diffusion,
                  and their specificities can be completely switched by partial
                  diffusion in the context of other family members. The designs
                  function as antagonists as monomers, and as superagonists when
                  presented trivalently for OX40 and at higher valency for
                  4-1BB. The ability to design high -affinity and specific
                  antagonists and agonists for a difficult but pharmacologically
                  important class of proteins entirely in silico, without any
                  large-scale screening or experimental optimization, presages a
                  new era in which binders are made by computation rather than
                  much more laborious and less controllable random screening
                  approaches.}

                  protein design has achieved successes such as artificial
                  enzymes and large protein cages. Membrane proteins present a
                  considerable design challenge, but here too there have been
                  advances, including the design of a zinc-transporting
                  tetramer. Lu et al. report the design of stable transmembrane
                  monomers, homodimers, trimers, and tetramers with up to eight
                  membrane-spanning regions in an oligomer. The designed
                  proteins adopted the target oligomerization state and
                  localized to the predicted cellular membranes, and crystal
                  structures of the designed dimer and tetramer reflected the
                  design models. Science, this issue p. 1042 Artificially
                  designed, stable, multitopic membrane proteins localize to the
                  plasma membrane in bacteria and in mammalian cells. The
                  computational design of transmembrane proteins with more than
                  one membrane-spanning region remains a major challenge. We
                  report the design of transmembrane monomers, homodimers,
                  trimers, and tetramers with 76 to 215 residue subunits
                  containing two to four membrane-spanning regions and up to 860
                  total residues that adopt the target oligomerization state in
                  detergent solution. The designed proteins localize to the
                  plasma membrane in bacteria and in mammalian cells, and
                  magnetic tweezer unfolding experiments in the membrane
                  indicate that they are very stable. Crystal structures of the
                  designed dimer and tetramer—a rocket-shaped structure with a
                  wide cytoplasmic base that funnels into eight transmembrane
                  helices—are very close to the design models. Our results pave
                  the way for the design of multispan membrane proteins with new

                  cholestatrienol and the naturally occurring dehydroergosterol
                  to mimic the unique properties of native cholesterol in lipid
                  membranes was studied in
                  1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)
                  membranes by electron paramagnetic resonance, nuclear magnetic
                  resonance, and fluorescence spectroscopy. As cholesterol, all
                  analogs undergo fluctuating motions of large amplitude
                  parallel to the bilayer normal. Native cholesterol keeps a
                  strict orientation in the membrane with the long axis parallel
                  to the bilayer normal. Depending on the chemical modification
                  or the position of the label, cholesterol analogs may adopt an
                  "up-side-down" orientation in the membrane or may even
                  fluctuate between "upright" and up-side-down orientation by
                  rotational motions about the short axis not typical for native
                  cholesterol. Those analogs are not able to induce a comparable
                  condensation of phospholipid membranes as known for native
                  cholesterol revealed by 2H nuclear magnetic resonance.
                  However, cholesterol-induced lipid condensation is one of the
                  key properties of native cholesterol, and, therefore, a well
                  suited parameter to assess the potential of steroid analogs to
                  mimic cholesterol. The study points to extreme caution when
                  studying cholesterol behavior by the respective analogs. Among
                  seven analogs investigated, only a spin-labeled cholesterol

                  understanding most biological mechanisms of cells and
                  organisms. In the case of small molecule-protein interactions,
                  many molecules have significant biological activity through
                  interactions with unknown target proteins and by unknown modes
                  of action. Identifying these target proteins is of significant
                  importance and ongoing work in our laboratories is developing
                  a technique termed Dynamic Isoelectric Anisotropy Binding
                  Ligand Assay (DIABLA) to meet this need. Work presented in
                  this manuscript aims to characterize the fundamental
                  parameters affecting the use of fluorescence anisotropy to
                  detect target proteins for a given ligand. Emphasis is placed
                  on evaluating the use of fluorescence anisotropy as a
                  detection mechanism, including optimization factors that
                  affect the protein detection limit. Effects of ligand
                  concentration, pH, and nonspecific binding are also examined.},

                  α-haemolysin protein pore with arylazopyrazole photoswitches,
                  we produced 'photopores' that transition between iontronic
                  resistor and diode modes in response to irradiation at
                  orthogonal wavelengths. In the diode mode, a low-leak
                  OFF-state nanopore exhibits a reversible increase in unitary
                  conductance of more than 20-fold upon irradiation at 365 nm. A
                  rectification ratio of >5 was achieved with photopores in the
                  diode state by either direct or alternating voltage input.
                  Unlike conventional electronic phototransistors with
                  intensity-dependent photoelectric responses, the photopores
                  regulated current output solely based on the wavelength(s) of
                  monochromatic or dual-wavelength irradiation. Dual-wavelength
                  irradiation at various relative intensities allowed graded
                  adjustment of the photopore conductance. By using these
                  properties, photonic signals encoding text or graphic messages
                  were converted into ionic signals, highlighting the potential
                  applications of photopores as components of smart devices in

  abstract     = {AlphaFold's ipTM metric is used to predict the accuracy of
                  structural predictions of protein-protein interactions (PPIs)
                  and the probability that two proteins interact. Many AF2/AF3
                  users have experienced the phenomenon that if they trim
                  full-length sequence constructs (e.g. from UniProt) to the
                  interacting domains (or domain+peptide), their ipTM scores go
                  up, even though the structure prediction of the interaction is
                  unchanged. The reason this happens is due to the mathematical
                  formulation of ipTM in AF2/AF3, which scores the interactions
                  of whole chains. If both chains in a PPI complex contain large
                  amounts of disorder or accessory domains that do not form the
                  primary domain-domain or domain/peptide interaction, the ipTM
                  score can be lowered significantly. The score then does not
                  accurately represent the accuracy of the structure prediction
                  nor whether the two proteins actually interact. We have solved
                  this problem by: 1) including only residue pairs in the ipTM
                  metric that have good predicted aligned error ( PAE ) scores;
                  2) by adjusting the d 0 parameter (a function of the length of
                  the query sequences) in the TM score equation to include only
                  the number of residues with good interchain PAE s to the
                  aligned residue; and 3) using the PAE value itself and not the
                  probability distributions over the aligned error to calculate
                  the pairwise residue-residue p T M values that go into the
                  ipTM calculation. The first two are crucial in calculating
                  high ipTM s for domain-domain and domain-peptide interactions
                  even in the presence of many hundreds of residues in
                  disordered regions and/or accessory domains. The third allows
                  us to require only the common output json files of AF2 and AF3
                  (including the server output) without having to change the
                  AlphaFold code and without affecting the accuracy. We show in
                  a benchmark that the new score, called ipSAE (interaction
                  prediction Score from Aligned Errors), is able to separate
                  true from false complexes more efficiently than AlphaFold2's
                  ipTM score. The resulting program is freely available at

                  protein activity through precise protein-solvent cooperative
                  interactions has not yet been demonstrated. Here we report the
                  design of 14 membrane receptors that catalyse G protein
                  nucleotide exchange through diverse engineered allosteric
                  pathways mediated by cooperative networks of intraprotein,
                  protein-ligand and -solvent molecule interactions. Consistent
                  with predictions, the designed protein activities correlated
                  well with the level of plasticity of the networks at flexible
                  transmembrane helical interfaces. Several designs displayed
                  considerably enhanced thermostability and activity compared
                  with related natural receptors. The most stable and active
                  variant crystallized in an unforeseen signalling-active
                  conformation, in excellent agreement with the design models.
                  The allosteric network topologies of the best designs bear
                  limited similarity to those of natural receptors and reveal an
                  allosteric interaction space larger than previously inferred
                  from natural proteins. The approach should prove useful for
                  engineering proteins with novel complex protein binding,

  abstract     = {AbstractMany proteins’ biological functions rely on
                  interconversions between multiple conformations occurring at
                  micro-to millisecond (µs-ms) timescales. A lack of
                  standardized, large-scale experimental data has hindered
                  obtaining a more predictive understanding of these motions.
                  After curating >100 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
                  relaxation datasets, we realized an observable for µs-ms
                  motion was hiding in plain sight. Millisecond motions can
                  cause NMR signals to broaden beyond detection, leaving some
                  residues not assigned in the chemical shift datasets of
                  ∼10,000 proteins deposited in the Biological Magnetic
                  Resonance Data Bank (BMRB)1. We made the bold assumption that
                  residues missing assignments are exchange-broadened due to
                  µs-ms motions, and trained various deep learning models to
                  predict missing assignments as markers for such dynamics.
                  Strikingly, these models also predict µs-ms motion directly
                  measured in NMR relaxation experiments. The best of these
                  models, which we named Dyna-1, leverages an intermediate layer
                  of the multimodal language model ESM-32. Notably, dynamics
                  directly linked to biological function — including enzyme
                  catalysis and ligand binding — are particularly well predicted
                  by Dyna-1, which parallels our findings that residues with
                  µs-ms motions are highly conserved. We anticipate the datasets
                  and models presented here will be transformative in unlocking
                  the common language of dynamics and function.},

                  constrained by the cost and scalability of DNA synthesis.
                  Here, we present OMEGA (Oligo-based Multiplexed Efficient Gene
                  Assembly), a low-cost, accessible method for assembling
                  hundreds to thousands of full-length genes in parallel using

                  fragments target genes into short, high-fidelity Golden
                  Gate-compatible oligonucleotides that can be ordered as a
                  pooled library and assembled across multiplexed subpools. We
                  systematically optimized the number of fragments per gene and
                  orthogonal ligation sites per reaction and determine that
                  OMEGA can assemble up to 2.6 kb constructs using as many as 70

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of protein-ligand interactions remains a
                  cornerstone challenge in drug discovery. AlphaFold3 (AF3), a
                  recent breakthrough Diffusion Transformer model, holds
                  significant promise for structural biology, but its
                  performance across diverse pharmaceutical applications
                  requires systematic evaluation. In this study, we
                  comprehensively benchmark AF3's capabilities using carefully
                  curated datasets, examining its performance in binary
                  protein-ligand complexes, apo/holo structural variations,
                  GPCR-ligand conformations, ternary systems, and inhibitor
                  affinity prediction. Our analysis reveals that AF3 excels at
                  predicting static protein-ligand interactions with minimal
                  conformational changes, significantly outperforming
                  traditional docking methods in side-chain orientation
                  accuracy. However, we identify critical limitations: AF3
                  struggles with protein-ligand complexes involving significant
                  conformational changes (>5A RMSD), demonstrates a persistent
                  bias toward active GPCR conformations regardless of ligand
                  type, performs poorly on ternary complex prediction, and lacks
                  reliable affinity ranking capability. Notably, AF3's
                  performance declined significantly on structures released
                  after its training cutoff date, suggesting potential
                  memorization rather than physical understanding of molecular
                  interactions. We explored AF3's practical utility through
                  applications in chemoproteomics data interpretation, drug
                  resistance mutation prediction, and kinome profiling
                  simulation. AF3 demonstrated value as a "true-hit binary
                  interaction modeler," capable of generating reliable
                  structural models for experimentally validated binding pairs.
                  However, its ranking metrics showed minimal correlation with
                  experimental binding affinities and limited ability to
                  differentiate across the kinome, highlighting the need for
                  integration with physics-based scoring methods. Our findings
                  indicate that while AF3 represents a significant advancement
                  in protein-ligand structure prediction, it requires
                  complementary approaches to address its limitations in
                  conformational sampling, affinity ranking, and complex system
                  modeling. Recent developments like YDS Ternoplex suggest that
                  enhanced sampling techniques can overcome some of these
                  limitations. The optimal strategy for leveraging AF3 in drug
                  discovery likely involves its integration into hybrid
                  computational pipelines that combine AI-based prediction with
                  physics-based refinement and experimental validation.},

                  (GPCRs) involves a population shift from inactive to active
                  receptor conformations in response to the binding of ligand
                  agonists. Two possible kinetic mechanisms for this population
                  shift are induced fit and conformational selection. The two
                  mechanisms differ in the temporal sequence of binding events
                  and conformational changes: Ligand bindings occurs prior to
                  the change from the inactive to the active receptor
                  conformation in the induced-fit mechanism, and after the
                  conformational change in the conformational-selection
                  mechanism. In this article, we discuss the current evidence
                  from experiments that probe the binding kinetics of GPCRs to
                  identify the allosteric mechanism. For the peptide-activated
                  neurotensin receptor, the modeling of kinetic data from
                  stopped-flow mixing experiments indicates an induced-fit
                  mechanism [1]. The conformational exchange rates of the
                  induced-fit mechanism obtained from this modeling agree with
                  rates measured by saturation transfer difference NMR
                  experiments of the peptide-receptor complex, which
                  corroborates the mechanism. For the small-molecule-activated
                  β2-andrenergic receptor, an induced-fit mechanism has been
                  inferred from a comparison of ligand-association rates for the
                  inactive and the active receptor conformation [2]. A
                  stabilization of the active receptor conformation by G
                  proteins or nanobodies leads to a decrease of ligand
                  association rates, which indicates that ligand binding occurs
                  in the inactive conformation and, thus, prior to the change
                  from the inactive to the active conformation as in the
                  induced-fit mechanism. A structural explanation for the
                  induced-fit mechanism of the β2-andrenergic receptor is a
                  closed lid over the binding site that blocks ligand entry in
                  the active conformation. Since constriction and closing of the
                  ligand-binding site in the active conformation is rather
                  common for small-molecule-activated and peptide-activated
                  GPCRs, induced fit likely is shared as allosteric mechanism by
                  these GPCRs.},

                  single-cell transcriptomics, continues to produce findings
                  that challenge the idea that cancer is a 'genetic disease', as
                  posited by the somatic mutation theory (SMT). In this
                  prevailing paradigm, tumorigenesis is caused by cancer-driving
                  somatic mutations and clonal expansion. However, results from
                  tumor sequencing, motivated by the genetic paradigm itself,
                  create apparent 'paradoxes' that are not conducive to a pure
                  SMT. But beyond genetic causation, the new results lend
                  credence to old ideas from organismal biology. To resolve
                  inconsistencies between the genetic paradigm of cancer and
                  biological reality, we must complement deep sequencing with
                  deep thinking: embrace formal theory and historicity of
                  biological entities, and (re)consider non-genetic plasticity
                  of cells and tissues. In this Essay, we discuss the concepts
                  of cell state dynamics and tissue fields that emerge from the
                  collective action of genes and of cells in their morphogenetic
                  context, respectively, and how they help explain
                  inconsistencies in the data in the context of SMT.},

                  membrane-translocating oligomers on membranes, contributing to
                  infection, immunity, and cell death functions. Binary toxins
                  produced by some bacteria consist of an enzymatic component
                  that acts as a toxin and a membrane-binding component that
                  forms a pore that delivers the enzymatic component into target
                  cells. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has advanced our
                  understanding of these translocation mechanisms by revealing
                  several binary toxin complexes structures. However, the
                  mechanisms underlying the initial pore formation remain
                  unclear. We determined the structures of several oligomeric
                  forms of the membrane-binding component, Ib, of the Iota toxin
                  from Clostridium perfringens at various stages of pore

                  symmetrically arranged soluble oligomer (prepore) became a
                  transmembrane oligomer (pore). These findings enhance our

                  assessing their ability to produce feasible, diverse, and
                  novel protein monomers. Structural diffusion models generally

                  exhibit limited diversity and strong sequence biases.
                  Conversely, protein language models generate more diverse and
                  novel designs but with lower structural confidence. We also
                  evaluated these models' ability to generate unique proteins,

                  human physiology — a detrimental pollutant but also a
                  protective nutrient and signaling ion — particularly as
                  connected to reactive nitrogen oxides. Aside from limited
                  insights into nitrate uptake and storage, foundational nitrate
                  biology has lagged. Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors
                  can address this gap with real-time imaging. However, imaging
                  technologies for mammalian cell applications remain rare.
                  Here, we set out to design and engineer a two-domain chimera
                  fusing the split green fluorescent protein EGFP and the
                  nitrate recognition domain NreA from Staphylococcus carnosus.
                  Over 7 rounds of directed evolution, 15 mutations were
                  accumulated resulting in the functional biosensor NitrOFF.
                  NitrOFF has a high degree of allosteric communication between
                  the domains reflected in a turn-off intensiometric response
                  (Kd≈ 9 μM). This was further reinforced by X-ray crystal
                  structures of apo and nitrate bound NitrOFF, which revealed
                  that the two domains undergo a large-scale conformational
                  rearrangement that changes the relative positioning of the
                  EGFP and NreA domains by 68.4°. Such a dramatic difference was
                  triggered by the formation of a long helix at the engineered
                  linker connecting the two domains, peeling the β7 strand off
                  the EGFP and thus extinguishing the fluorescence upon nitrate
                  binding. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we highlighted the
                  utility of this first-generation biosensor to monitor
                  exogenous nitrate uptake and modulation in a human embryonic

                  descriptions consisting of constellations of catalytic residue
                  functional groups around reaction transition state(s), and
                  seeks to generate protein structures that can accurately hold
                  the site in place. Highly active enzymes have been designed
                  starting from such descriptions using the generative AI method
                  RFdiffusion, but there are two current methodological
                  limitations. First, the geometry of the active site can only
                  be specified at the residue level, so for each catalytic
                  residue functional group placed around the reaction transition
                  state, the possible locations of the residue backbone must be
                  enumerated by building side chain rotamers back from the
                  functional group. Second, the location of the catalytic
                  residues along the sequence must be specified in advance,
                  which considerably limits the space of solutions which can be
                  sampled. Here we describe a new deep generative method,
                  RoseTTAFold diffusion 2 (RFdiffusion2), that solves both
                  problems, enabling enzymes to be designed from sequence
                  agnostic descriptions of functional group locations without
                  inverse rotamer generation. We first evaluate RFdiffusion2 on
                  an in silico enzyme design benchmark of 41 diverse active
                  sites and find that it is able to successfully build proteins
                  scaffolding all 41 sites, compared to 16/41 with prior
                  state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Next, we design
                  enzymes around three diverse catalytic sites and characterize
                  the designs experimentally; in each case we identify active
                  catalysts in testing less than 96 sequences. RFdiffusion2
                  demonstrates the potential of atomic resolution generative
                  models for the design of de novo enzymes directly from their
                  reaction mechanisms.}

                  essential contributor of conformational entropy and affects
                  processes such as folding, stability and molecular
                  interactions. Structure determination experiments and
                  prediction tools such as AlphaFold generally fail to capture
                  or represent the conformational heterogeneity of proteins in
                  solution. Experiments can be used to study side-chain
                  flexibility, but cannot be applied at scale, and most
                  prediction methods focus on reconstructing the minimum free
                  energy state rather than an ensemble representing side-chain
                  configurations. Here, we use AlphaFold2 and its internal
                  side-chain representations to develop AF2χ that predicts
                  side-chain χ-angle distributions and generates structural
                  ensembles. We extensively benchmark AF2χ predictions using
                  experimental NMR 3 J -couplings and s 2 order parameters, as
                  well as dihedral angle distributions derived from collections
                  of experimental structures, demonstrating the accuracy of AF2χ
                  in generating accurate side-chain ensembles. We also compare
                  the accuracy of AF2χ with molecular dynamics simulations and
                  recent machine learning models aimed to generate
                  conformational ensembles and show that AF2χ provides
                  state-of-the-art accuracy orders of magnitude faster than
                  molecular simulations. With its speed and accuracy, AF2χ
                  offers a strong complementary option to simulations and
                  rotamer library approaches, making it particularly valuable
                  for applications such as protein design, ligand docking and

                  emerging musicians was selected from Ibadan and Lagos in
                  Nigeria through snowballing. An initial questionnaire schedule
                  was used to collect data about the respondents’ backgrounds

                  role and use of social media. Contact between the researcher
                  and the musicians was created using video call approaches. The
                  musicians are motivated to use social media to express
                  themselves, connect with other musicians, and expand their
                  audiences. Social media platforms allow audiences to be more
                  expressive because they do not involve face-to-face
                  interactions, but rather the disclosure and organization of
                  information. Viral social media challenges, remaking of
                  popular and trending songs, and other video contents related

                  power dynamics through three of the most important markets
                  that Spotify—the leading audio streaming platform—is embedded
                  within: the music market; the advertising market; and the

                  Playlists can be seen as a central example of how platforms
                  like Spotify employ curation or “curatorial power” to mediate
                  markets in the attempt to advance their own interests. At the
                  same time, playlists are an outcome of the conflicting
                  pressures and tensions between these markets. As such, they
                  provide a lens through which to view broader structural

               confusion by the glory of Newtonian physics. Einstein’s results

                  filaments rely on random processes to facilitate topological
                  changes. Here we introduce a method of \textit{topological
                  steering} to determine the optimal pathway by which a filament
                  may knot or unknot while subject to a given set of physics.
                  The method involves measuring the knotoid spectrum of a space
                  curve projected onto many surfaces and computing the mean
                  unravelling number of those projections. Several perturbations
                  of a curve can be generated stochastically, e.g. using the
                  Langevin equation or crankshaft moves, and a gradient can be
                  followed that maximises or minimises the topological
                  complexity. We apply this method to a polymer model based on a
                  growing self-avoiding tangent-sphere chain, which can be made
                  to model proteins by imposing a constraint that the bending
                  and twisting angles between successive spheres must maintain
                  the distribution found in naturally occurring protein
                  structures. We show that without these protein-like geometric
                  constraints, topologically optimised polymers typically form
                  alternating torus knots and composites thereof, similar to the
                  stochastic knots predicted for long DNA. However, when the
                  geometric constraints are imposed on the system, the frequency
                  of twist knots increases, similar to the observed abundance of
                  twist knots in protein structures.},

                  transfer of lipids from a donor membrane, typically the
                  endoplasmic reticulum, to an acceptor membrane, such as that
                  of the cell or an organelle1. Although BLTPs are fundamentally
                  important for a wide array of cellular functions, their
                  architecture, composition and lipid-transfer mechanisms remain
                  poorly characterized. Here we present the subunit composition
                  and the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the native
                  LPD-3 BLTP complex isolated from transgenic Caenorhabditis
                  elegans. LPD-3 folds into an elongated, rod-shaped tunnel of
                  which the interior is filled with ordered lipid molecules that
                  are coordinated by a track of ionizable residues that line one
                  side of the tunnel. LPD-3 forms a complex with two previously
                  uncharacterized proteins, one of which we have named Spigot
                  and the other of which remains unnamed. Spigot interacts with
                  the N-terminal end of LPD-3 where lipids are expected to enter
                  the tunnel, and experiments in multiple model systems indicate
                  that Spigot has a conserved role in BLTP function. Our LPD-3
                  complex structural data reveal protein-lipid interactions that
                  suggest a model for how the native LPD-3 complex mediates bulk

                  deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by a number of structurally
                  related organic solvents has been investigated. In all the
                  solvents investigated, denaturation is accompanied by 35–50\%
                  increase in absorbance (at 259 mμ) and a decrease in optical
                  rotation (at 436 mμ) of 200–350 °. The following observations
                  have been made: (a) The effectiveness of the denaturant
                  increases with both chain length and increasing hydrocarbon
                  content. Thus ethyl and propyl alcohols were found to be more
                  effective than methanol. (b) The alkyl-substituted solvents
                  N,N′-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, and
                  tetramethylurea are the most effective denaturants among the
                  various solvents employed. The midpoints of the denaturation
                  transition due to these solvents in the presence of 1–5 ×
                  10−2M salt, range from 19 to 27 mole \% (57–62 vol.\%), and
                  the changes produced in optical rotation (at 436 mμ) upon
                  denaturation are of the order of −300 to −350 °. (c)
                  N,N′-dimethylformamide is a more effective DNA denaturant than
                  formamide. (d) Increasing the hydroxyl content of the solvent,
                  on the other hand, had no significant effect; the denaturation
                  midpoints in methanol-water and ethylene glycol-water mixtures
                  (in the presence of 0.5–5 × 10−2M salt) occur at 80 ± 1 mole
                  \% (90 ± 2 vol.\%) of the nonaqueous component. These
                  observations demonstrate the importance of hydrophobic forces
                  and argue against the assignment of the stability of the
                  aqueous configuration of DNA solely to hydrogen bonds.Except
                  in dimethyl sulfoxide, DNA denaturation by the organic
                  solvents employed could be largely reversed by water in the

                  practices, technological affordances and cultural meanings.
                  Drawing on qualitative interviews and online ethnography with
                  indie music enthusiasts in China, the research explores two
                  key aspects of streaming music consumption to examine music’s
                  materiality: playlisting practices and users’ reflexive
                  interactions with recommendation algorithms. The findings
                  reveal a co-evolutionary relationship between user practices
                  and technological affordances, where both users and algorithms
                  actively shape the experience and materiality of music.

                  pathways. It has been proposed that the molecular evolution of
                  such pathways must have required each step to increase the
                  capacity of its product to condense and order phospholipids.
                  Here, we carry out a systematic analysis of the ergosterol
                  pathway that leverages the yeast vacuole's capacity to phase
                  separate into ordered membrane domains. In the post-synthetic
                  steps specific to ergosterol biosynthesis, we find that
                  successive modifications act to oscillate ordering capacity,
                  settling on a level that supports phase separation while
                  retaining fluidity of the resulting domains. Simulations
                  carried out with each intermediate showed how conformers in
                  the sterol's alkyl tail are capable of modulating long-range
                  ordering of phospholipids, which could underlie changes in
                  phase behavior. Our results indicate that the complexity of
                  sterol metabolism could have resulted from the need to balance

  abstract     = {Proteins are essential macromolecules defined by their amino
                  acid sequences, which determine their three-dimensional
                  structures and, consequently, their functions in all living
                  organisms. Therefore, generative protein modeling necessitates
                  a multimodal approach to simultaneously model, understand, and
                  generate both sequences and structures. However, existing
                  methods typically use separate models for each modality,
                  limiting their ability to capture the intricate relationships
                  between sequence and structure. This results in suboptimal
                  performance in tasks that requires joint understanding and
                  generation of both modalities. In this paper, we introduce
                  DPLM-2, a multimodal protein foundation model that extends
                  discrete diffusion protein language model (DPLM) to
                  accommodate both sequences and structures. To enable
                  structural learning with the language model, 3D coordinates
                  are converted to discrete tokens using a lookup-free
                  quantization-based tokenizer. By training on both experimental
                  and high-quality synthetic structures, DPLM-2 learns the joint
                  distribution of sequence and structure, as well as their
                  marginals and conditionals. We also implement an efficient
                  warm-up strategy to exploit the connection between large-scale
                  evolutionary data and structural inductive biases from
                  pre-trained sequence-based protein language models. Empirical
                  evaluation shows that DPLM-2 can simultaneously generate
                  highly compatible amino acid sequences and their corresponding
                  3D structures eliminating the need for a two-stage generation

                  musicians, during the advent of early recording technology,
                  altered their style of play to be better captured by
                  microphones—this article explores some of the “platform
                  effects” that arise in the shift to platformization and how
                  cultural goods and user practices are re-formatted in the
                  process. In particular, I examine the case of the music
                  streaming service Spotify to think through the variety of
                  means, sonic, and otherwise, that artists, labels, and other
                  platform stakeholders use to “optimize” music to respond to
                  the pressures platformization creates. I develop a typology of
                  strategies—sonic optimization, data optimization, and
                  infrastructural optimization—to consider the creative and
                  logistical challenges optimization poses for platforms,
                  artists, and users alike. From creating playlist friendly
                  songs to musical spam to artificial play counts, I use the
                  blurry lines these cases create to explore the tensions
                  between the competing needs of platform providers, content
                  producers, and users. I argue that music, as data, adds
                  pressure on musicians and producers to think and act like
                  software developers and coders, treating their music not just
                  as songs that need to reach listeners, but as an intermingling
                  of sonic content and coded metadata that needs to be prepared
                  and readied for discovery. This optimization of culture, and
                  the pressures it creates, affects not just musicians, but
                  content producers of all kinds (e.g., video, podcasts, apps,
                  books, etc.) who are forced to negotiate their relationships
                  digital culture and the platforms through which it circulates.},

                  modeling efforts. Recent studies suggest that AlphaFold (AF) -
                  a revolutionary deep learning model for biomolecular structure
                  prediction - has implicitly learned an approximate biophysical
                  energy function. While many researchers highly rely on
                  AF-derived scores for structure evaluation, existing
                  AlphaFold2-based implementations require iterative refinement
                  of the input structure, leading to biased scoring. To address
                  this limitation, we adapted AlphaFold3 into a score-only
                  model, AF3Score, by directly feeding input coordinates into
                  the confidence head while bypassing the diffusion-based
                  structure module. AF3Score demonstrates robust performance in
                  structural quality assessment across diverse systems including
                  monomeric proteins, protein-protein complexes, de novo
                  designed binders, and fold-switching proteins. In benchmarking
                  designed binder screening, AF3Score outperformed
                  state-of-the-art methods for 8 out of 10 targets. Moreover,
                  combining AF3Score with AlphaFold2-derived methods
                  significantly improved the enrichment of experimentally
                  validated binders, increasing the success rate from 15.2\% to
                  31.6\%. Additionally, AF3Score effectively identified stable
                  conformations in fold-switching proteins, whereas AlphaFold
                  predominantly predicted only the dominant fold. These findings
                  highlight the broad applicability of AF3Score, from
                  high-throughput screening in de novo binder design to
                  filtering docking-generated poses and molecular dynamics (MD)

                  the protein-protein interactions in the case when experimental
                  3D structures of the complexes are not available. The docking
                  often rely on known unbound (Apo) protein structures, which
                  may differ significantly from their bound (Holo) forms. Modern
                  machine learning (ML) based conformational sampling techniques
                  allow generating ensembles of functionally relevant protein
                  structures, which may be closer to their Holo forms and thus
                  could improve the outcomes of the classical rigid
                  protein-protein docking. Here we sampled conformations of the
                  protein subunits in 30 complexes from the novel PLINDER
                  dataset with two state-of-the-art ML-based techniques and

                  corresponding Apo ones. Moreover, even when such conformations
                  are generated, none of the tested scoring functions were able
                  to prioritize and rank them correctly. Our work highlights
                  critical limitations in the current ML-enhanced rigid

                  heterogeneous cleavage and release pathways of ssDNA by Exo I.
                  The results demonstrate a stepwise cleavage that is
                  sequence-dependent on short ssDNA molecules (<15 nt), which
                  differs from the kinetic model based on bulk measurements. In
                  addition, we show that damaged DNA irreversibly changes the

                  input the 3D coordinates of a protein pair and outputs a

                  used due to its high success rates when working with synthetic

                  performance on the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs)

                  native antibodies or failing to refold into the designed
                  conformations. We also show that this underperformance can be
                  rescued by ensembling its predictions with those from the
                  antibody-specific protein language model AbLang, which designs
                  exclusively using sequence information learned from large

                  and inexpensive precursors, ADDing click handles can be
                  performed in a streamlined, one-pot workflow combining

                  contradictory decrease in the test line (T) intensity and
                  false-negative results. The hook effect is mainly associated
                  with the loss of T, and research focuses on minimizing this
                  effect. Nevertheless, the control line (C) intensity is also
                  affected at higher analyte concentrations, undesirably
                  influencing the T/C ratio in LFIA readers. The main aim of
                  this work is to identify and understand these high antigen
                  concentration effects in order to develop ubiquitous
                  strategies to interpret and mitigate such effects. Four
                  complementary experiments were performed: performance
                  assessment of three different allergen LFIAs (two for
                  hazelnut, one for peanut) over 0.075-3500 ppm, LFIAs with C
                  only, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding experiments on
                  the immobilized control antibody, and smartphone video
                  recording of LFIAs during their development. As antigen
                  concentrations increase, the C signal decreases before the T
                  signal does, suggesting that distinct mechanisms underlie
                  these intensity reductions. Reduced binding at the C occurred
                  even in the absence of T, so the upfront T does not explain
                  the loss of C. SPR confirmed that the C antibody favors
                  binding with free labeled antibody compared with a labeled
                  antibody-analyte complex, indicating that in antigen excess,
                  binding is reduced at C before T. Finally, a smartphone-based
                  video method was developed for dynamically monitoring the LFIA
                  development in real time to distinguish between different
                  concentration-dependent effects. Digitally analyzing the data
                  allows clear differentiation of highly positive samples and
                  false-negative samples and can indicate whether the LFIA is in
                  the dynamic working range or at critically high
                  concentrations. The aim of this work is to identify and

                  modular multi-domain proteins help expand the functional
                  repertoire of proteins. Because of their larger size and often
                  substantial dynamics, it may be difficult to characterize the
                  conformational ensembles of multi-domain proteins by
                  simulations. Here, we present a coarse-grained model for
                  multi-domain proteins that is both fast and provides an
                  accurate description of the global conformational properties
                  in solution. We show that the accuracy of a
                  one-bead-per-residue coarse-grained model depends on how the
                  interaction sites in the folded domains are represented.
                  Specifically, we find excessive domain-domain interactions if
                  the interaction sites are located at the position of the Cα
                  atoms. We also show that if the interaction sites are located
                  at the center of mass of the residue, we obtain good agreement
                  between simulations and experiments across a wide range of

                  the resulting model using independent data. Finally, we use

                  disordered and multi-domain proteins, and to examine how the

                  understanding interactions between folded and disordered
                  regions in proteins, and how these regions affect the

                  cells by inhibiting oncogenic signaling pathways such as Ras
                  1–4 . This renders them susceptible to resistance and limits
                  their long-term clinical efficacy 4–10 . Engineered protein
                  circuits 11–25 have been envisioned as an alternative to
                  pharmacological inhibition that directly rewires oncogenic
                  activity to cell death. However, it has remained unclear
                  whether engineered protein circuits can potently and safely
                  treat cancers. Here, we show that Ras-targeting circuits can
                  accurately discriminate between cancer and non-cancer cells,
                  circumvent intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms that
                  limit pharmacological inhibitors, and suppress cancer in vivo
                  . These circuits combine three modules: a protease-based
                  sensor that responds to a broad spectrum of clinically
                  relevant Ras mutations, an optional protease amplifier, and
                  protease-triggered cell death effectors. These effectors can
                  flexibly trigger either non-inflammatory apoptosis or
                  immunogenic pyroptosis, which has been shown to extend
                  therapeutic effects beyond transfected cells 26,27 . The
                  resulting sense-kill circuits can be safely, efficiently, and
                  transiently delivered to cells as mRNA in lipid nanoparticles
                  (LNPs). The circuits exhibited potent efficacy against
                  Ras-mutant human cancer cell lines with minimal off-target
                  killing of wild-type Ras cells. In immunocompetent mice
                  bearing aggressive, multifocal Ras-driven liver tumors,
                  systemically-delivered mRNA-LNP circuits significantly reduced
                  tumor burden. Further, therapeutic circuits provided more
                  potent killing of Ras-mutant cancer cells than the Ras
                  inhibitors Sotorasib and RMC-7977 7,28–30 , and exhibited
                  increased sensitivity to Sotorasib-resistant cells in vitro .

                  nascent polypeptide chains along folding pathways towards
                  biologically active states. A hallmark of the co-translational
                  folding (coTF) of many proteins are highly stable folding
                  intermediates that are absent or only transiently populated
                  off the ribosome, yet persist during translation well-beyond
                  complete emergence of the domain from the ribosome exit
                  tunnel. Intermediates are important for folding fidelity;
                  however, their structures have remained elusive. Here, we have
                  structurally characterised two coTF intermediates of an
                  immunoglobulin-like domain by developing comprehensive 19 F
                  NMR analyses using chemical shifts, paramagnetic relaxation
                  enhancement (PRE), and protein engineering. We integrated
                  these experimental data with extensive molecular dynamics (MD)
                  simulations to obtain atomistic structures of the folding
                  intermediates on the ribosome. The resulting intermediate
                  structures are distinguished by native-like folds initiated
                  from either their N-or C-termini, and reveal parallel folding
                  pathways, which are structurally conserved within the protein
                  domain family, in contrast to their in vitro refolding
                  mechanisms. By redirecting proteins to fold along
                  hierarchical, parallel routes, the ribosome may promote
                  efficient folding by avoiding kinetic traps, and regulate
                  nascent chain assembly and targeting by auxiliary factors to
                  maintain cellular proteostasis.}

                  does not guarantee designability--the likelihood that a
                  designed sequence folds into the desired structure. To bridge
                  this gap, we redefine the training objective by steering
                  sequence generation toward high designability. To do this, we
                  integrate Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), using
                  AlphaFold pLDDT scores as the preference signal, which
                  significantly improves the in silico design success rate. To
                  further refine sequence generation at a finer, residue-level
                  granularity, we introduce Residue-level Designability
                  Preference Optimization (ResiDPO), which applies residue-level
                  structural rewards and decouples optimization across residues.
                  This enables direct improvement in designability while
                  preserving regions that already perform well. Using a curated

                  a large, high-quality database of transmembrane β-barrels
                  (TMBB). By applying simple feature detection on generated
                  evolutionary contact maps, our method (IsItABarrel) achieves
                  95.88\% balanced accuracy when discriminating among protein
                  classes. Moreover, comparison with IsItABarrel revealed a high
                  rate of false positives in previous TMBB algorithms. In
                  addition to being more accurate than previous datasets, our
                  database (available online) contains 1,938,936 bacterial TMBB
                  proteins from 38 phyla, respectively, 17 and 2.2 times larger

                  useful resource where high-quality TMBB sequence data are

                  three of which have not been previously reported. We find
                  tremendous variance in proteome percentage among
                  TMBB-containing organisms with some using 6.79\% of their
                  proteome for TMBBs and others using as little as 0.27\% of
                  their proteome. The distribution of the lengths of the TMBBs
                  is suggestive of previously hypothesized duplication events.
                  In addition, we find that the C-terminal β-signal varies among
                  different classes of bacteria though its consensus sequence is
                  LGLGYRF. However, this β-signal is only characteristic of
                  prototypical TMBBs. The ten non-prototypical barrel types have
                  other C-terminal motifs, and it remains to be determined if
                  these alternative motifs facilitate TMBB insertion or perform
                  any other signaling function.},

                  systems with reduced computational costs. CG models achieve it
                  by discarding atomic information necessary for downstream
                  structural analysis. Recovering the atomic detail from CG
                  structures, i.e. backmapping, remains a fundamental challenge
                  in multiscale modeling, especially for proteins and complex
                  biomolecular assemblies. Recent machine learning methods have
                  shown promise in reconstructing atomistic details, but most
                  approaches only target simple systems at a small scale. In
                  particular, conventional backmapping pipelines often fail to
                  preserve stereochemistry, induce high-energy configurations,
                  or require extensive minimization. Here we present CGBack, a
                  backmapping framework that employs a denoising diffusion
                  probabilistic model to reconstruct all-atom molecular
                  structures from CG representations. CGBack consists of
                  backmapping and refinement procedures and accurately recovers
                  atomic coordinates across diverse protein systems from small
                  to large scales. We show that CGBack is capable of accurately
                  backmapping both single-chain and multi-chain molecular
                  systems, including densely packed intrinsically disordered
                  proteins in condensates. These results suggest that CGBack can

                  large-scale applications. In this work, we address the
                  challenge of balancing model efficiency and prediction
                  accuracy by making several key modifications, 1) Multi-step
                  AF3 sampler is replaced by a few-step ODE sampler,
                  significantly reducing computational overhead for the
                  diffusion module part during inference; 2) In the open-source
                  Protenix framework, a subset of pairformer or diffusion
                  transformer blocks doesn't make contributions to the final
                  structure prediction, presenting opportunities for
                  architectural pruning and lightweight redesign; 3) A model
                  incorporating an ESM module is trained to substitute the
                  conventional MSA module, reducing MSA preprocessing time.
                  Building on these key insights, we present Protenix-Mini, a
                  compact and optimized model designed for efficient protein
                  structure prediction. This streamlined version incorporates a
                  more efficient architectural design with a two-step Ordinary
                  Differential Equation (ODE) sampling strategy. By eliminating
                  redundant Transformer components and refining the sampling
                  process, Protenix-Mini significantly reduces model complexity
                  with slight accuracy drop. Evaluations on benchmark datasets
                  demonstrate that it achieves high-fidelity predictions, with
                  only a negligible 1 to 5 percent decrease in performance on
                  benchmark datasets compared to its full-scale counterpart.
                  This makes Protenix-Mini an ideal choice for applications

                  design have emerged. Yet, only few tackle the difficult task
                  of directly generating fully atomistic structures jointly with
                  the underlying amino acid sequence. This is challenging, for
                  instance, because the model must reason over side chains that
                  change in length during generation. We introduce La-Proteina
                  for atomistic protein design based on a novel partially latent
                  protein representation: coarse backbone structure is modeled
                  explicitly, while sequence and atomistic details are captured
                  via per-residue latent variables of fixed dimensionality,
                  thereby effectively side-stepping challenges of explicit
                  side-chain representations. Flow matching in this partially
                  latent space then models the joint distribution over sequences
                  and full-atom structures. La-Proteina achieves
                  state-of-the-art performance on multiple generation
                  benchmarks, including all-atom co-designability, diversity,
                  and structural validity, as confirmed through detailed
                  structural analyses and evaluations. Notably, La-Proteina also
                  surpasses previous models in atomistic motif scaffolding
                  performance, unlocking critical atomistic
                  structure-conditioned protein design tasks. Moreover,
                  La-Proteina is able to generate co-designable proteins of up
                  to 800 residues, a regime where most baselines collapse and
                  fail to produce valid samples, demonstrating La-Proteina's

                  biology. Despite this, the process of crystallization remains
                  poorly understood and highly empirical, with crystal contacts,
                  lattice packing arrangements and space group preferences being
                  largely unpredictable. Programming protein crystallization
                  through precisely engineered side-chain-side-chain
                  interactions across protein-protein interfaces is an
                  outstanding challenge. Here we develop a general computational
                  approach for designing three-dimensional protein crystals with
                  prespecified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that
                  hierarchically constrains the overall number of degrees of
                  freedom of the system. We design three pairs of oligomers that
                  can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously
                  self-assemble into >100 µm three-dimensional crystals. The
                  structures of these crystals are nearly identical to the
                  computational design models, closely corresponding in both
                  overall architecture and the specific protein-protein
                  interactions. The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be
                  systematically redesigned while retaining the space group
                  symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are
                  extremely porous and highly stable. Our approach enables the
                  computational design of protein crystals with high accuracy,
                  and the designed protein crystals, which have both structural
                  and assembly information encoded in their primary sequences,

                  signals to how pharmaceutical compounds can be used to treat
                  diseases. Quantitative and predictive free energy calculations
                  require computational models that accurately capture both the
                  varied and intricate electronic interactions between molecules
                  as well as the entropic contributions from motions of these
                  molecules and their aqueous environment. However, accurate
                  quantum-mechanical energies and forces can only be obtained
                  for small atomistic models, not for large biomacromolecules.
                  Here, we demonstrate how to consistently link accurate
                  quantum-mechanical data obtained for substructures to the
                  overall potential energy of biomolecular complexes by machine
                  learning in an integrated algorithm. We do so using a two-fold
                  quantum embedding strategy where the innermost quantum cores
                  are treated at a very high level of accuracy. We demonstrate
                  the viability of this approach for the molecular recognition
                  of a ruthenium-based anticancer drug by its protein target,
                  applying traditional quantum chemical methods. As such methods

                  impact the resulting free energies. Once the requirements are
                  met, our computational pipeline FreeQuantum is able to make
                  efficient use of the quantum computed energies, thereby
                  enabling quantum computing enhanced modeling of biochemical
                  processes. This approach combines the exponential speedups of
                  quantum computers for simulating interacting electrons with
                  modern classical simulation techniques that incorporate

                  accuracy, positioning it as a valuable resource for
                  data-driven protein design. However, its direct use in
                  training deep models that are sensitive to fine-grained atomic
                  geometry, such as inverse folding, exposes a critical
                  limitation. Comparative analysis of structural feature
                  distributions reveals that AFDB structures exhibit distinct
                  statistical regularities, reflecting a systematic geometric
                  bias that deviates from the conformational diversity found in
                  experimentally determined structures from the Protein Data

                  downstream tasks. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a
                  Debiasing Structure AutoEncoder (DeSAE) that learns to
                  reconstruct native-like conformations from intentionally
                  corrupted backbone geometries. By training the model to
                  recover plausible structural states, DeSAE implicitly captures
                  a more robust and natural structural manifold. At inference,
                  applying DeSAE to AFDB structures produces debiased structures
                  that significantly improve inverse folding performance across
                  multiple benchmarks. This work highlights the critical impact
                  of subtle systematic biases in predicted structures and
                  presents a principled framework for debiasing, significantly
                  boosting the performance of structure-based learning tasks
                  like inverse folding.}

  abstract     = {Mutations in protein active sites can dramatically improve
                  function. The active site, however, is densely packed and
                  extremely sensitive to mutations. Therefore, some mutations
                  may only be tolerated in combination with others in a
                  phenomenon known as epistasis. Epistasis reduces the
                  likelihood of obtaining improved functional variants and
                  dramatically slows natural and lab evolutionary processes.
                  Research has shed light on the molecular origins of epistasis
                  and its role in shaping evolutionary trajectories and
                  outcomes. In addition, sequence- and AI-based strategies that
                  infer epistatic relationships from mutational patterns in
                  natural or experimental evolution data have been used to
                  design functional protein variants. In recent years,
                  combinations of such approaches and atomistic design
                  calculations have successfully predicted highly functional
                  combinatorial mutations in active sites. These were used to
                  design thousands of functional active-site variants,
                  demonstrating that, while our understanding of epistasis
                  remains incomplete, some of the determinants that are critical
                  for accurate design are now sufficiently understood. We
                  conclude that the space of active-site variants that has been
                  explored by evolution may be expanded dramatically to enhance
                  natural activities or discover new ones. Furthermore, design
                  opens the way to systematically exploring sequence and
                  structure space and mutational impacts on function, deepening
                  our understanding and control over protein activity.},

                  a kinetic selection assay, and machine learning to massively
                  perturb the energetics of the nucleation reaction of amyloid-β

                  Aβ42 to accurately quantify the changes in free energy of
                  activation of the reaction for all possible amino acid

                  competitive performance. However, challenges remain, such as
                  predicting elements with high structural uncertainty,
                  including disordered regions. To tackle such low-confidence
                  residue prediction, we propose a mask-prior-guided denoising
                  diffusion (MapDiff) framework that accurately captures both
                  structural information and residue interactions for inverse
                  protein folding. MapDiff is a discrete diffusion probabilistic
                  model that iteratively generates amino acid sequences with
                  reduced noise, conditioned on a given protein backbone. To
                  incorporate structural information and residue interactions,
                  we have developed a graph-based denoising network with a
                  mask-prior pretraining strategy. Moreover, in the generative
                  process, we combine the denoising diffusion implicit model
                  with Monte-Carlo dropout to reduce uncertainty. Evaluation on
                  four challenging sequence design benchmarks shows that MapDiff
                  substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
                  Furthermore, the in silico sequences generated by MapDiff
                  closely resemble the physico-chemical and structural

                  exploration of cellular function and various functional
                  stages. While most multi-omic studies focused on dual RNA and
                  protein analysis of single cell population, it is crucial to
                  include lipid and metabolite profiling to comprehensively
                  elucidate molecular mechanisms and pathways governing cell
                  function, as well as phenotype at different functional stages.
                  Methods: To address this gap, a cellular lipidomics and
                  transcriptomics phenotyping approach employing simultaneous
                  extraction of lipids, metabolites, and RNA from single cell
                  populations combined with untargeted cellular 4 dimensional
                  (4D)-lipidomics profiling along with RNA sequencing was

                  early-stage identification of cellular phenotype changes in
                  pathological and physiological conditions we implemented this
                  approach for phenotyping of macrophages in two different

                  model for atherosclerosis protection, and wild type
                  macrophages. Results and Discussion: This multi-omic study
                  enabled the determination of the lipid content remodeling in
                  macrophages with anti-inflammatory and atherosclerotic
                  protective function acquired by MyD88-KO, hence expedites the
                  understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind immune cells
                  effector functionality and of possible molecular targets for
                  therapeutic intervention. An enriched functional role of

                  semi-synthetic products are used to treat various diseases1,2.
                  The central C ring forms the core pharmacophore for ergot
                  alkaloids, giving them structural similarity to
                  neurotransmitters, thus enabling their modulation of
                  neurotransmitter receptors3. The haem catalase chanoclavine
                  synthase (EasC) catalyses the construction of this ring
                  through complex radical oxidative cyclization4. Unlike
                  canonical catalases, which catalyse H2O2
                  disproportionation5,6, EasC and its homologues represent a
                  broader class of catalases that catalyse O2-dependent radical
                  reactions4,7. We have elucidated the structure of EasC by
                  cryo-electron microscopy, revealing a nicotinamide adenine
                  dinucleotide phosphate (reduced) (NADPH)-binding pocket and a
                  haem pocket common to all haem catalases, with a unique
                  homodimeric architecture that is, to our knowledge, previously
                  unobserved. The substrate prechanoclavine unprecedentedly
                  binds in the NADPH-binding pocket, instead of the previously
                  suspected haem-binding pocket, and two pockets were connected
                  by a slender tunnel. Contrary to the established mechanisms,
                  EasC uses superoxide rather than the more generally used
                  transient haem iron-oxygen complexes (such as compounds I, II
                  and III)8,9, to mediate substrate transformation through
                  superoxide-mediated cooperative catalysis of the two distant
                  pockets. We propose that this reactive oxygen species
                  mechanism could be widespread in metalloenzyme-catalysed

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Extracellular histone H3 is implicated in several
                  pathologies including inflammation, cell death, and organ
                  failure. Neutralization of histone H3 is a strategy that was
                  shown beneficial in various diseases, such as rheumatoid
                  arthritis, myocardial infarction, and sepsis. It was shown
                  that activated protein C (APC) can cleave histone H3, which
                  reduces histone cytotoxicity. However, due to the
                  anticoagulant properties of APC, the use of APC is not optimal
                  for the treatment of histone-mediated cytotoxicity, in view of
                  its associated bleeding side effects. OBJECTIVES: This study
                  aimed to investigate the detailed molecular interactions
                  between human APC and human histone H3, and subsequently use
                  molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation methods to
                  identify key interacting residues that mediate the interaction
                  between APC and histone H3 and to generate novel optimized APC
                  variants. METHODS: After molecular simulations, the designed
                  APC variants 3D2D-APC (Lys37-39Asp and Lys62-63Asp) and
                  3D2D2A-APC (Lys37-39Asp, Lys62-63Asp, and Arg74-75Ala) were
                  recombinantly expressed and their abilities to function as
                  anticoagulant, to bind histones, and to cleave histones were
                  tested and correlated with their cytoprotective properties.
                  RESULTS: Compared with wild type-APC, both the 3D2D-APC and
                  3D2D2A-APC variants showed a significantly decreased
                  anticoagulant activity, increased binding to histone H3, and
                  similar ability to proteolyze histone H3. CONCLUSIONS: Our
                  data show that it is possible to rationally design APC
                  variants that may be further developed into therapeutic
                  biologicals to treat histone-mediated disease, by proteolytic
                  reduction of histone-associated cytotoxic properties that do
                  not induce an increased bleeding risk.},

                  Current cardiovascular risk prediction mainly focuses on
                  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels, neglecting
                  other contributing risk factors. Moreover, the efficacy of
                  LDL-c lowering by statins resulting in reduced cardiovascular
                  risk is only partially effective. Secondly, from a
                  metrological viewpoint LDL-c falls short as a reliable
                  measurand. Both direct and calculated LDL-c tests produce
                  inaccurate test results at the low end under aggressive lipid
                  lowering therapy. As LDL-c tests underperform both clinically
                  and metrologically, there is an urging need for molecularly
                  defined biomarkers. Over the years, apolipoproteins have
                  emerged as promising biomarkers in the context of
                  cardiovascular disease as they are the functional workhorses

                  present on all atherogenic lipoprotein particles, has
                  demonstrated to clinically outperform LDL-c. Other
                  apolipoproteins, such as Apo(a) - the characteristic
                  apolipoprotein of the emerging risk factor lipoprotein(a) -,
                  and ApoC-III - an inhibitor of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein

                  sequences across evolution may have promise toward generative
                  protein design. However it is unknown whether language models,
                  trained on sequences of natural proteins, will be capable of
                  more than memorization of existing protein families. Here we
                  show that language models generalize beyond natural proteins
                  to generatede novoproteins. We focus on two protein design
                  tasks: fixed backbone design where the structure is specified,
                  and unconstrained generation where the structure is sampled
                  from the model. Remarkably although the models are trained
                  only on sequences, we find that they are capable of designing
                  structure. A total of 228 generated proteins are evaluated
                  experimentally with high overall success rates (152/228 or
                  67\%) in producing a soluble and monomeric species by size
                  exclusion chromatography. Out of 152 experimentally successful
                  designs, 35 have no significant sequence match to known
                  natural proteins. Of the remaining 117, sequence identity to
                  the nearest sequence match is at median 27\%, below 20\% for 6
                  designs, and as low as 18\% for 3 designs. For fixed backbone
                  design, the language model generates successful designs for
                  each of eight experimentally evaluated artificially created
                  fixed backbone targets. For unconstrained generation, sampled
                  proteins cover diverse topologies and secondary structure
                  compositions, and have high experimental success rate (71/129
                  or 55\%). The designs reflect deep patterns linking sequence
                  and structure, including motifs that occur in related natural
                  structures, and motifs that are not observed in similar
                  structural contexts in known protein families. The results
                  show that language models, though only trained on sequences,
                  learn a deep grammar that enables the design of protein
                  structure, extending beyond natural proteins.},

                  aggregate, thus resulting in low functional yields. Human
                  acetylcholinesterase (hAChE), an enzyme mediating synaptic
                  transmission, is a typical case of a human protein that
                  necessitates mammalian systems to obtain functional
                  expression. We developed a computational strategy and designed
                  an AChE variant bearing 51 mutations that improved core
                  packing, surface polarity, and backbone rigidity. This variant
                  expressed at ∼2,000-fold higher levels in E. coli compared to
                  wild-type hAChE and exhibited 20°C higher thermostability with
                  no change in enzymatic properties or in the active-site
                  configuration as determined by crystallography. To demonstrate
                  broad utility, we similarly designed four other human and
                  bacterial proteins. Testing at most three designs per protein,
                  we obtained enhanced stability and/or higher yields of soluble
                  and active protein in E. coli. Our algorithm requires only a

                  preferences has made targeting such systems challenging. We

                  dramatic increase in reliability and scale. With these
                  advances, dozens and even thousands of designed proteins are
                  automatically generated and screened. Nevertheless, the
                  success rate, particularly in design of functional proteins,
                  is low and fundamental goals such as reliable de novo design
                  of efficient enzymes remain beyond reach. Experimental
                  analyses have consistently indicated that a major reason for
                  design failure is inaccuracy and misfolding relative to the
                  design conception. To address this challenge, we describe
                  complementary methods to diagnose and ameliorate suboptimal
                  regions in designed proteins: first, we develop a Rosetta
                  atomistic computational mutation scanning approach to detect
                  energetically suboptimal positions in designs (available on a
                  web server https://pSUFER.weizmann.ac.il); second, we
                  demonstrate that AlphaFold2 ab initio structure prediction
                  flags regions that may misfold in designed enzymes and
                  binders; and third, we focus FuncLib design calculations on
                  suboptimal positions in a previously designed low-efficiency
                  enzyme, improving its catalytic efficiency by 330-fold.
                  Furthermore, applied to a de novo designed protein that
                  exhibited limited stability, the same approach markedly
                  improved stability and expressibility. Thus, foldability
                  analysis and enhancement may dramatically increase the success
                  rate in design of functional proteins.},

                  diversity of disciplinary perspectives brought to bear on the
                  question. Despite significant progress in our understanding of
                  biological systems, psychology, computation, and information
                  theory, no single definition for life has yet achieved
                  universal acceptance. This challenge becomes increasingly
                  urgent as advances in synthetic biology, artificial
                  intelligence, and astrobiology challenge our traditional
                  conceptions of what it means to be alive. We undertook a
                  methodological approach that leverages large language models
                  (LLMs) to analyze a set of definitions of life provided by a
                  curated set of cross-disciplinary experts. We used a novel
                  pairwise correlation analysis to map the definitions into
                  distinct feature vectors, followed by agglomerative
                  clustering, intra-cluster semantic analysis, and t-SNE
                  projection to reveal underlying conceptual archetypes. This
                  methodology revealed a continuous landscape of the themes
                  relating to the definition of life, suggesting that what has
                  historically been approached as a binary taxonomic problem
                  should be instead conceived as differentiated perspectives
                  within a unified conceptual latent space. We offer a new
                  methodological bridge between reductionist and holistic
                  approaches to fundamental questions in science and philosophy,
                  demonstrating how computational semantic analysis can reveal
                  conceptual patterns across disciplinary boundaries, and
                  opening similar pathways for addressing other contested

                  the molecular library, rather than obtaining data at only one
                  time point. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a
                  single-molecule strategy for this omics analysis to elucidate
                  the biosystem heterogeneity and temporal dynamics. In this
                  Perspective, we explore the potential application of nanopores
                  for single-molecule temporal omics to characterize individual
                  molecules beyond mass, in both a single-molecule and
                  high-throughput manner. Accordingly, recent advances in
                  nanopores available for single-molecule temporal omics are
                  reviewed from the view of single-molecule mass identification,
                  revealing single-molecule heterogeneity and illustrating
                  temporal evolution. Furthermore, we discuss the primary
                  challenges associated with using nanopores for single-molecule
                  temporal omics in complex biological samples, and present the
                  potential strategies and notes to respond to these challenges.},

                  combined with high-throughput cell biology. The solution is
                  for analysis of measurements to start and end with an
                  interpretation of effect size. In this manuscript, I walk
                  through some of the common critiques of significance testing
                  and how they relate to experimental cell biology. I argue that

                  central position in the planning and discussion of cell

                  scaling single-sequence models and their training data,
                  requiring vast compute resources that limit accessibility.
                  Although models that use multiple sequence alignments (MSA),
                  such as MSA Transformer, offer parameter-efficient
                  alternatives by extracting evolutionary information directly
                  from homologous sequences rather than storing it in
                  parameters, they generally underperform compared to
                  single-sequence-based language due to memory inefficiencies
                  that limit the number of sequences and averaging evolutionary
                  signals across the MSA. We address these challenges with MSA
                  Pairformer, a 111M parameter memory-efficient MSA-based
                  protein language model that extracts evolutionary signals most
                  relevant to a query sequence through bi-directional updates of
                  sequence and pairwise representations. MSA Pairformer achieves
                  state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised contact
                  prediction, outperforming ESM2-15B by 6\% points while using
                  two orders of magnitude fewer parameters. In predicting
                  contacts at protein-protein interfaces, MSA Pairformer
                  substantially outperforms all methods with a 24\% point
                  increase over MSA Transformer. Unlike single-sequence models
                  that deteriorate in variant effect prediction as they scale,
                  MSA Pairformer maintains strong performance in both tasks.
                  Ablation studies reveal triangle operations remove indirect
                  correlations, and unlike MSA Transformer, MSA Pairformer does
                  not hallucinate contacts after removing covariance, enabling
                  reliable screening of interacting sequence pairs. Overall, our
                  work presents an alternative to the current scaling paradigm
                  in protein language modeling, enabling efficient adaptation to
                  rapidly expanding sequence databases and opening new

                  controlling where proteins operate in cells and underpins many
                  fundamental processes, from embryonic patterning to synaptic
                  plasticity. This spatial control is mediated by RNA-binding
                  proteins (RBPs) that interact with localization signals within
                  target mRNAs. However, these signals lack overt sequence or
                  structural patterns, even when targeted by the same protein,
                  raising the question of how specificity is achieved. Here, we
                  investigate this question using the Drosophila RBP Egalitarian
                  (Egl), which couples developmentally important mRNAs to
                  microtubule-based transport via Bicaudal D (BicD) and the
                  dynein motor protein. We present cryo-EM structures of
                  Egl-BicD in complex with six different RNAs. Egl uses multiple
                  non-canonical double-stranded RNA-binding domains to
                  cooperatively form a recognition pocket around a localization
                  signal. Despite substantial variation in length and sequence,
                  each signal adopts a bent stem-loop conformation that,
                  together with base-pair identities at two defined sites,
                  drives Egl binding. We further demonstrate that Egl dimers
                  couple RNA binding to transport initiation through coincident
                  detection of two RNA elements within the same transcript.
                  Collectively, we show that diverse localizing mRNAs are
                  recognized through a combination of shape, positional sequence
                  features, and number of structured RNA elements. This work
                  provides a framework for understanding how other RBPs engage
                  highly variable mRNAs.}

                  relevant glycopolymers including heparin, hyaluronic acid, and
                  mucin significantly stabilize folding of the N-terminal domain
                  of the Drk-SH3 protein. These interactions are enthalpically
                  stabilizing, emphasizing the importance of chemical
                  interactions for biologically relevant crowders. We further
                  show that these glycopolymers stabilize a homodimer formed by
                  the A34F variant of GB1, demonstrating that biological
                  crowders not only affect isolated proteins, but also influence
                  how proteins interact with one another. Crowding is more
                  complex than simple ideas of volume exclusion suggest, and our
                  work guides a more comprehensive understanding of protein
                  crowding in the context of the glycocalyx, the last frontier
                  of the cell. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors

  abstract     = {De novo protein design aims to create novel protein structures
                  and sequences, often to enable specific functions. Most
                  current generative models operate on simplified backbone-only
                  representations. However, in vivo and in vitro protein folding
                  and function are largely mediated by amino acid sidechains.
                  Given this biochemical relevance, we ask: what happens when
                  sidechain and sequence information are introduced into a
                  protein generative model? To address this, we developed
                  SiBaSe, a novel generative model that simultaneously
                  co-designs sidechains, backbones, and sequence. SiBaSe
                  achieves design performance approaching that of
                  state-of-the-art backbone-only models. However, analysis of
                  design patterns reveals that, despite access to sidechain
                  data, the model behaves similarly to a backbone-based model.
                  This appears to arise from uncertainties in the simultaneous
                  modeling of sequence and sidechains that are inherent to
                  flow-based architectures and offers new insight into
                  architectural limitations and opportunities for improving

  abstract     = {Drug discovery is fundamentally a process of inferring the
                  effects of treatments on patients, and would therefore benefit
                  immensely from computational models that can reliably simulate
                  patient responses, enabling researchers to generate and test
                  large numbers of therapeutic hypotheses safely and
                  economically before initiating costly clinical trials. Even a
                  more specific model that predicts the functional response of
                  cells to a wide range of perturbations would be tremendously
                  valuable for discovering safe and effective treatments that
                  successfully translate to the clinic. Creating such virtual
                  cells has long been a goal of the computational research
                  community that unfortunately remains unachieved given the
                  daunting complexity and scale of cellular biology.
                  Nevertheless, recent advances in AI, computing power, lab
                  automation, and high-throughput cellular profiling provide new
                  opportunities for reaching this goal. In this perspective, we
                  present a vision for developing and evaluating virtual cells
                  that builds on our experience at Recursion. We argue that in
                  order to be a useful tool to discover novel biology, virtual
                  cells must accurately predict the functional response of a
                  cell to perturbations and explain how the predicted response
                  is a consequence of modifications to key biomolecular
                  interactions. We then introduce key principles for designing
                  therapeutically-relevant virtual cells, describe a
                  lab-in-the-loop approach for generating novel insights with
                  them, and advocate for biologically-grounded benchmarks to
                  guide virtual cell development. Finally, we make the case that
                  our approach to virtual cells provides a useful framework for
                  building other models at higher levels of organization,
                  including virtual patients. We hope that these directions
                  prove useful to the research community in developing virtual
                  models optimized for positive impact on drug discovery

                  designs and analytical characteristics, opening the door for
                  their widespread implementation in clinical laboratories.
                  Clinical endocrinology is closely linked to laboratory
                  medicine because hormone quantification is important for the
                  diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of endocrine disorders.
                  Several interferences in immunoassays have been identified
                  through the years; although some are no longer encountered in
                  daily practice, cross-reaction, heterophile antibodies,
                  biotin, and anti-analyte antibodies still cause problems.
                  Newer interferences are also emerging with the development of
                  new therapies. The interfering substance may be exogenous
                  (e.g., a drug or substance absorbed by the patient) or
                  endogenous (e.g., antibodies produced by the patient), and the
                  bias caused by interference can be positive or negative. The
                  consequences of interference can be deleterious when
                  clinicians consider erroneous results to establish a
                  diagnosis, leading to unnecessary explorations or
                  inappropriate treatments. Clinical laboratories and
                  manufacturers continue to investigate methods for the
                  detection, elimination, and prevention of interferences.
                  However, no system is completely devoid of such incidents. In

                  biomedical and clinical relevance is still controversial due
                  to the complexity of cortisol secretion mechanisms and their
                  circadian cycles as well as environmental factors that affect
                  physiological cortisol level, which include individual mood
                  and dietary intake. To further investigate this multifaceted
                  relationship, a human pilot study examined cortisol
                  concentration in sweat and saliva samples collected from 48
                  college-aged participants during aerobic exercise sessions
                  along with mental distress and nutrition surveys.
                  Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays determined highly
                  significant differences between apocrine-dominant sweat (AP),
                  saliva before exercise (SBE), and saliva after exercise (SAE)
                  cortisol concentration (AP-SBE: p = 0.0017, AP-SAE: p =
                  0.0102). A significantly greater AP cortisol concentration was
                  detected in males compared to females (p = 0.0559), and
                  significant SAE cortisol concentration differences were also
                  recorded between recreational athletes and non-athletes (p =
                  0.044). However, Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10)
                  scores, an examination administered to deduce overall
                  wellness, provided no significant differences between males
                  and females or athletes and non-athletes in distress levels,
                  which statistically signifies a direct relationship to
                  cortisol was not present. For further analysis, dietary intake
                  from all participants was considered to investigate whether a
                  multiplexed association was prevalent between nutrition, mood,
                  and cortisol release. Significant positive correlations
                  between AP cortisol, SAE cortisol, K10 scores, and fat intake
                  among female participants and athletes were discovered. The
                  various machine learning algorithms utilized the extensive
                  connections between dietary intake, overall well-being, sex
                  factors, athletic activity, and cortisol concentrations in
                  various biofluids to predict K10 scores. Indeed, the
                  understanding of physiochemical stress response and the
                  associations between studied factors can advance algorithm
                  developments for cortisol biosensing systems to mitigate
                  stress-based illnesses and improve an individual's quality of
                  life.},

                  In this work, we test flow-induced dispersion analysis (FIDA)
                  as a method for screening binders in a time and cost-effective
                  manner. FIDA uses Taylor dispersion analysis to determine the
                  hydrodynamic radius of fluorescently labeled biomolecules and
                  their complexes. Here, we use FIDA to assess the binding of
                  RFdiffusion-designed protein binders against the small helical
                  peptide ALFA-tag and the guanylate kinase (GK) domain of

                  such robustness emerges through evolution, and how it relates
                  to the underlying sequence-structure map, remains poorly
                  understood. In contrast, the mutational profiles (distribution
                  of structures upon point mutation) of RNA secondary structures
                  are well characterised, exhibiting both high mutational
                  robustness and high evolvability through mutational access to
                  diverse folds. The recent revolution in protein structure
                  prediction now enables analagous large-scale analyses for
                  proteins. Here, we use the structure prediction algorithm
                  ESMFold to systematically investigate the mutational profiles
                  of natural, random, and de novo proteins. Unlike RNA, where
                  functional and random sequences share similar mutational
                  profiles, natural proteins are substantially more robust than
                  random amino acid sequences, suggesting an evolutionary drive
                  toward robustness. They also exhibit limited structural
                  variation among close sequence neighbours, potentially
                  constraining access to new folds. Interestingly, many de novo
                  proteins do resemble random sequences in their mutational
                  profiles, with low robustness relative to established
                  proteins. These findings reveal how gene duplication and de
                  novo gene birth follow distinct evolutionary trajectories
                  toward functional proteins and highlight a potential role for

                  4-residue beta turns which represent 63\% of the residues in
                  loops. The commonly used classification of beta turns (Type I,
                  I', II, II', VIa1, VIa2, VIb, and VIII) was developed in the
                  1970s and 1980s from analysis of a small number of proteins of
                  average resolution, and represents only two thirds of beta
                  turns observed in proteins (with a generic class Type IV
                  representing the rest). We present a new clustering of
                  beta-turn conformations from a set of 13,030 turns from 1074
                  ultra-high resolution protein structures (≤1.2 Å). Our
                  clustering is derived from applying the DBSCAN and k-medoids
                  algorithms to this data set with a metric commonly used in
                  directional statistics applied to the set of dihedral angles
                  from the second and third residues of each turn. We define 18
                  turn types compared to the 8 classical turn types in common
                  use. We propose a new 2-letter nomenclature for all 18
                  beta-turn types using Ramachandran region names for the two
                  central residues (e.g., 'A' and 'D' for alpha regions on the
                  left side of the Ramachandran map and 'a' and 'd' for
                  equivalent regions on the right-hand side; classical Type I
                  turns are 'AD' turns and Type I' turns are 'ad'). We identify
                  11 new types of beta turn, 5 of which are sub-types of
                  classical beta-turn types. Up-to-date statistics, probability
                  densities of conformations, and sequence profiles of beta
                  turns in loops were collected and analyzed. A library of turn
                  types, BetaTurnLib18, and cross-platform software,
                  BetaTurnTool18, which identifies turns in an input protein

                  provide useful tools for protein structure determination,

                  placed on the cell necessitating that there be flexibility in

                  part be achieved through the organization of enzymes into
                  metabolon supercomplexes. However, the composition and
                  organization of such supercomplexes remain unclear. Here, we
                  identified protein-protein interactions between
                  acyltransferases Sct1, Gpt2, Slc1, Dga1, and the Δ9 acyl-CoA
                  desaturase Ole1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We further
                  determined that a subset of these acyltransferases interact
                  with each other independent of Ole1. We show that truncated
                  versions of Dga1 lacking the carboxyl-terminal 20 amino acid
                  residues are nonfunctional and unable to bind Ole1.
                  Furthermore, charged-to-alanine scanning mutagenesis revealed
                  that a cluster of charged residues near the carboxyl terminus
                  was required for the interaction with Ole1. Mutation of these
                  charged residues disrupted the interaction between Dga1 and
                  Ole1 but allowed Dga1 to retain catalytic activity and to

                  applications. While there has been some success in
                  reprogramming naturally occurring DBPs using selection
                  methods, the computational design of new DBPs that recognize
                  arbitrary target sites remains an outstanding challenge. We
                  describe a computational method for the design of small DBPs
                  that recognize short specific target sequences through
                  interactions with bases in the major groove and use this
                  method to generate binders for five distinct DNA targets with
                  mid-nanomolar to high-nanomolar affinities. The individual
                  binding modules have specificity closely matching the
                  computational models at as many as six base-pair positions and
                  higher-order specificity can be achieved by rigidly
                  positioning the binders along the DNA double helix using
                  RFdiffusion. The crystal structure of a designed DBP-target
                  site complex is in close agreement with the design model and
                  the designed DBPs function in both Escherichia coli and
                  mammalian cells to repress and activate transcription of
                  neighboring genes. Our method provides a route to small and,
                  hence, readily deliverable sequence-specific DBPs for gene
                  regulation and editing.},

                  limited by low success rates that currently require
                  resource-intensive screening. Here, we introduce Germinal, a
                  broadly enabling generative framework that designs antibodies
                  against specific epitopes with nanomolar binding affinities
                  while requiring only low-throughput experimental testing. Our
                  method co-optimizes antibody structure and sequence by
                  integrating a structure predictor with an antibody-specific
                  protein language model to perform de novo design of functional
                  complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) onto a
                  user-specified structural framework. When tested against four
                  diverse protein targets, Germinal achieved an experimental
                  success rate of 4-22\% across all targets, testing only 43-101
                  designs for each antigen. Validated nanobodies also exhibited
                  robust expression in mammalian cells and nanomolar binding
                  affinities. We provide open-source code and full computational
                  and experimental protocols to facilitate wide adoption.
                  Germinal represents a milestone in low-throughput,
                  epitope-targeted de novo antibody design, with notable

                  ribosome profiling, we show that nearly 20\% of mitochondrial
                  proteins can be imported cotranslationally in human cells.
                  Cotranslational import requires an N-terminal presequence on
                  the nascent protein and contributes to localized translation
                  at the mitochondrial surface. This pathway does not favor
                  membrane proteins but instead prioritizes large, multi-domain,
                  topologically complex proteins, whose import efficiency is
                  enhanced when targeted cotranslationally. In contrast to the
                  early onset of cotranslational protein targeting to the
                  endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the presequence on mitochondrial

                  using the anthrax toxin protective antigen nanopore, we
                  describe a high-performance machine learning (ML) framework
                  for classifying a diverse series of guest-host peptides based
                  on individual translocation events. The approach leverages
                  carefully engineered, event-level biophysical features
                  extracted from either scaled current and conductance state
                  sequences. Through systematic UMAP analysis of this feature
                  space, we reveal that filtering away the shortest events
                  effectively enriches the dataset with more discriminative
                  longer events, leading to improved classification. Various
                  deep learning (DL) and traditional ML architectures, including
                  convolutional neural networks (CNN), temporal convolutional
                  networks (TCN), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were
                  investigated. The dual-input CNN-Dense model, which utilized
                  current sequences and features, achieved strong classification
                  performance (accuracy ∼0.80). However, the most robust
                  classification was achieved with XGBoost acting solely on the
                  engineered feature set, demonstrating superior performance
                  (accuracy ∼0.90). This ML approach provided a significant
                  computational advantage in both training and inference over DL
                  models. Notably, these models consistently discriminated
                  between peptides differing only in backbone stereochemistry,
                  highlighting the exquisite sensitivity of the nanopore to
                  subtle conformational dynamics. These findings underscore that
                  carefully engineered event-level features, particularly from
                  longer translocations, combined with efficient tree-based
                  models, offer a highly effective and computationally favorable

                  scalable and cost-effective protocol, enabling up to
                  milligram-scale protein production, and standardized
                  characterization including yield, dispersity, and oligomeric
                  state of hundreds of designs per day, at the cost-equivalent
                  of a few DNA oligos per construct. End-to-end protocol
                  execution takes 48 hours, with about 6 hours spent benchside
                  using mostly standard laboratory equipment. This protocol has
                  become the standard at our institute, providing critical
                  experimental validation for dozens of projects spanning tens
                  of thousands of designs. Since at least 80\% of SAPP’s total
                  cost comes from synthetic DNA, we also developed a scalable
                  demultiplexing protocol (DMX) to leverage oligo pools as input
                  DNA, providing a further 5-fold reduction in costs, enabling
                  >1000 designs to be purified and characterized in arrayed,
                  clonal format at a cost of \$5 per construct. By reframing
                  standard molecular biology practices and orchestrating wetlab
                  workflows with partial automation instead of complex
                  end-to-end robotics, these protocols should be widely
                  adoptable, accelerating protein design.}

                  tremendously, but few dynamic protein systems have been
                  designed. Here we present the design and characterization of a
                  random protein walker that diffuses along a designed protein
                  track. For the track, we designed micro-meter long fibres and
                  developed a method to rigidly decorate them with arbitrary
                  proteins. The walkers consist of homo-oligomers that
                  reversibly bind the track using heterodimeric feet; we tested
                  multiple heterodimer interfaces for reversibility and designed
                  six walkers with different numbers of feet. Cryo-EM
                  experiments confirmed the structure of the track and walkers.
                  We performed detailed single molecule tracking and kinetics
                  characterisation and found that the walkers diffuse along the
                  track, and that those with more feet diffuse faster. The

                  synthetic biology is emulating such sophisticated behaviors in
                  liposome-based synthetic cells (SCs). Fabricating
                  communication networks in lipid bilayer-based SCs remains a
                  challenge, as signaling molecules must transit through two
                  consecutive membranes to transfer information between
                  different SCs. Here, we address this obstacle by engineering
                  connexin channels that directly connect the lumens of adhering
                  SC membranes. We focus on orthogonal channel-forming
                  connexins, namely connexin 43 and connexin 32, and redesign
                  their channel activity to be UV- and near IR-responsive,
                  respectively. By combining engineered connexins into a single
                  SC assembly, we demonstrate orthogonal transfer of reactive
                  signaling molecules between SCs, giving rise to unique
                  reaction products and network states in a wavelength-dependent

                  methods aim to predict these interactions accurately, yet
                  membrane proteins remain particularly difficult due to the
                  added thermodynamic effects of the lipid bilayer. Alchemical
                  free-energy calculations provide state-of-the-art accuracy by
                  transforming one ligand into another, and recent
                  non-equilibrium approaches (NEQ-FEP) offer improved efficiency
                  and parallelization. However, no existing workflow automates
                  NEQ-FEP for membrane proteins and enables decomposition of the
                  observed binding free energy into membrane-partitioning and
                  protein-specific components. NEMAT is an open-source pipeline
                  that performs automated non-equilibrium alchemical
                  transformations in water, membranes, and membrane-embedded
                  protein environments. Here we show that NEMAT reproduces
                  experimental binding-energy trends for P2Y 1 ligands with
                  accuracy comparable to established equilibrium methods. These
                  findings demonstrate that NEQ-FEP can be applied reliably to
                  membrane systems when supported by a consistent workflow. In
                  contrast to previous approaches, NEMAT provides systematic
                  control over transition length, sampling, and replica
                  averaging, enabling stable work-distribution overlap and
                  reproducible free-energy estimates. In a broader context,
                  NEMAT offers a practical route to mechanistically
                  interpretable affinity predictions for membrane-embedded
                  targets. Its ability to dissect membrane and protein
                  contributions advances our understanding of ligand selectivity
                  at lipid-facing pockets and supports the routine application
                  of non-equilibrium free-energy methods in drug discovery.},

                  group leaders to improve research culture in the life

                  group leaders working in eight different European countries.
                  We also report the results of a survey in which we asked more
                  than 200 researchers, at various career stages, about the
                  commitments. Even though all 30 commitments were rated as
                  significantly important by respondents, implementation rates
                  were notably low (<25\%). However, more than 95\% of group

               1.1 L'explication d'une pratique ou d'un usage Les enquêtes par
               questionnaire portent le plus souvent sur une pratique : par
               exemple, le repas en famille, la fréquentation d'une
               bibliothèque, le vote à l'élection présidentielle, la prière, les
               achats de vêtements, l'action bénévole 1. Au départ, au sein du
               réel, une zone correspondant à cette pratique est délimitée, du
               fait de la demande d'un commanditaire (privé ou public). La très
               grande majorité des enquêtes quantitatives ont un financement, et
               renvoient à une demande plus ou moins précise. Cette demande,
               cette « question » (au sens de questionnement)-à l'origine de la
               recherche-porte notamment sur les usages (et les non-usages) d'un
               équipement, d'un produit proposé. Le sociologue doit répondre à
               cette question en mettant en oeuvre la démarche explicative. Il
               doit recherche les facteurs déterminants, et les facteurs
               associés à cette pratique ou cette non-pratique, ou à tel ou tel
               type d'usage. Par exemple, pour la lecture d'un enfant, on
               considérera que le niveau de lecture de ses parents est un
               facteur déterminant alors que le fait de fréquenter une
               bibliothèque (pour l'enfant) sera jugé comme un facteur associé
               (l'enfant peut aller à la bibliothèque parce qu'il aime lire, il
               peut aimer lire parce qu'il fréquente une bibliothèque 2).},
