  abstract     = {Protein language models (PLMs) have emerged as a useful
                  resource for protein engineering applications. Transfer
                  learning (TL) leverages pre-trained parameters to extract
                  features to train machine learning models or adjust the
                  weights of PLMs for novel tasks via fine-tuning through
                  back-propagation. TL methods have shown potential for
                  enhancing protein predictions performance when paired with
                  PLMs, however there is a notable lack of comparative analyses
                  that benchmark TL methods applied to state-of-the-art PLMs,
                  identify optimal strategies for transferring knowledge and
                  determine the most suitable approach for specific tasks. Here,
                  we report PLMFit, a benchmarking study that combines, three
                  state-of-the-art PLMs (ESM2, ProGen2, ProteinBert), with three
                  TL methods (feature extraction, low-rank adaptation,
                  bottleneck adapters) for five protein engineering datasets. We
                  conducted over >3,150 in silico experiments, altering PLM
                  sizes and layers, TL hyperparameters and different training
                  procedures. Our experiments reveal three key findings: (i)
                  utilizing a partial fraction of PLM for TL does not
                  detrimentally impact performance, (ii) the choice between
                  feature extraction and fine-tuning is primarily dictated by
                  the amount and diversity of data and (iii) fine-tuning is most
                  effective when generalization is necessary and only limited
                  data is available. We provide PLMFit as an open-source
                  software package, serving as a valuable resource for the
                  scientific community to facilitate the feature extraction and
                  fine-tuning of PLMs for various applications.},

                  Current methods for visualizing lipid localization do not meet
                  this requirement. Here, we introduce a correlative light and
                  electron microscopy workflow to image lipids (Lipid-CLEM),
                  combining near-native lipid probes and on-section labeling by

                  neuronal genome architecture1-3, constitute a biochemical
                  enigma. This is because regulatory DNA elements make selective
                  and stable contacts with DNA sequences located hundreds of
                  kilobases away, instead of interacting with proximal sequences
                  occupied by the exact same transcription factors1,4. This is
                  exemplified in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), in which only
                  a fraction of LHX2-, EBF1- and LDB1-bound sites interact with
                  each other, converging into highly selective multi-chromosomal
                  enhancer hubs5. To obtain biochemical insight into this
                  process, here we assembled olfactory receptor (OR) enhancer
                  hubs in vitro with recombinant proteins and enhancer DNA.
                  Cell-free reconstitution of enhancer hubs revealed that OR
                  enhancers form nucleoprotein condensates with unusual,
                  solid-like characteristics. Assembly of these solid
                  condensates is orchestrated by specific DNA motifs enriched in
                  OR enhancers, which are likely to confer distinct homotypic
                  properties on their resident LHX2-EBF1-LDB1 complexes.
                  Single-molecule tracking and pulse-chase experiments in vivo
                  confirmed that LHX2 and EBF1 assemble
                  OR-transcription-competent condensates with solid properties
                  in OSN nuclei, under physiological concentrations of protein.
                  Thus, homophilic nucleoprotein interactions that are
                  influenced by DNA sequence generate new types of biomolecular
                  condensate, which might provide a generalizable explanation

                  Nb development methods against membrane proteins in a
                  native-like membrane environment. To address this need, we
                  present a protocol for Nb selection via extraction of membrane
                  proteins into amphiphilic polymers such as styrene-maleic acid

                  differing fold, oligomerization state, and membrane topology
                  (reentrant membrane helix, transmembrane,

                  selectivity towards their target proteins with K D apparent
                  values ranging from 15 nM to 200 nM, depending on the
                  Nb-protein conjugate. In accordance with their tight binding,
                  various Nb-protein complexes were found to be stable to
                  size-exclusion chromatography purification. The Nbs were also
                  amenable to sortase-mediated ligation, enabling their
                  conversion into molecular probes for the target membrane
                  protein. The ability to select for such high-affinity Nb
                  against membrane proteins in SMALP will facilitate their

                  densely packed core that controls their stability. Despite
                  their importance, we lack a quantitative explanation for why
                  all protein cores, regardless of their overall fold, possess
                  the same average packing fraction 〈ϕ〉≈0.55. However, important
                  developments in the physics of jamming in particulate systems
                  can shed light on the packing of protein cores. Here, we
                  extend the framework of jamming to describe core packing in
                  collapsed polymers, as well as in all-atom models of folded
                  proteins. First, we show in a spherical bead-spring polymer
                  model (with and without bond-angle constraints) that as the
                  hydrophobic interactions increase relative to thermal
                  fluctuations, a jamming-like transition occurs when the core
                  packing fraction exceeds ϕc with the same power-law scaling
                  behavior for the potential energy Vr, excess contact number
                  ΔN, and characteristic frequency of the vibrational density of
                  states ω* versus Δϕ=ϕ−ϕc as that for jammed particulate
                  systems. Then, we develop an all-atom model for proteins and
                  find that, above ϕc∼0.55, protein cores undergo a jamming-like
                  transition, but with anomalous power-law scaling for Vr, ΔN,
                  and ω* versus Δϕ. The all-atom protein model remains close to
                  the native protein structure during jamming and accurately
                  refolds from partially unfolded states. Published by the

  abstract     = {AbstractThe flexibility of tethered molecules, such as those
                  bound to biological membranes, is an important property that
                  can influence molecular height, mobility, and accessibility.
                  However, quantifying the flexibility of surface-tethered
                  biomolecules in aqueous environments has been difficult due to
                  a lack of experimental tools. Here we introduce SurFlex
                  microscopy, a method based on fluorescence anisotropy that
                  exploits the relationship between the conformational dynamics
                  of a tethered molecule and the rotational diffusion of an
                  attached fluorophore to extract information about molecular
                  flexibility. By analyzing the polarization state of photons
                  emitted after polarized excitation, we quantify apparent
                  molecular flexibilities that include effects of tethering,
                  self-interactions and buffer conditions. We first demonstrate
                  the capabilities of SurFlex microscopy by measuring the
                  flexibility of bilayer-tethered single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) of
                  different lengths and nucleotide sequences. We find that
                  sequence significantly impacts ssDNA flexibility, consistent
                  with theoretical estimates, with weak intramolecular
                  interactions in random sequences leading to higher apparent
                  stiffness. Interestingly, we show that a pathological DNA
                  sequence linked to Huntington’s disease exhibits unusual
                  flexibility despite intramolecular interactions. We next
                  extend SurFlex microscopy to live cells by measuring surface
                  glycoprotein flexibility on red blood cells using fluorescent
                  lectins. We show that trypsinization decreases glycan
                  fluctuations, demonstrating that modifications to the cell
                  surface can alter the flexibility of remaining surface
                  molecules. SurFlex microscopy provides a new tool for
                  quantifying molecular flexibility that can be used to study
                  the role of tethered surface molecules in fundamental
                  biological processes.Significance statementBiomolecules
                  immobilized on one end play crucial roles in diverse cellular
                  processes, from cell-cell signaling through surface receptors
                  to the formation of DNA secondary structures. However,
                  measuring biomolecular flexibility on surfaces has remained
                  challenging. Here we present SurFlex microscopy, a technique
                  that uses fluorescence anisotropy to quantify the flexibility
                  of surface-anchored molecules. By analyzing the rotational
                  dynamics of fluorophores attached to the ends of fluctuating
                  biomolecules, SurFlex microscopy can be used to quantify
                  persistence length. We demonstrate its capabilities by
                  measuring sequence-dependent flexibility of DNA and
                  crowding-dependent changes in glycan flexibility on native
                  cell surfaces. This method opens new avenues for understanding
                  how biomolecular flexibility influences key biological
                  processes, such as those at cell surfaces during cell-cell
                  contact formation and subsequent signaling.},

                  a suitable optimisation routinea priori. Nevertheless, many
                  attempts have been made to design optimisation routines
                  specifically for ion channel models, however, little work has
                  been done to compare these optimisation approaches. We have
                  developed ionBench, an open-source optimisation bench- marking
                  framework, to evaluate and compare these approaches against a
                  standard set of ion channel optimisation problems. We included
                  implementations of thirty-four unique optimisation approaches

                  This distribution was found to be generally similar to the

                  which more than 80\% was discharged into the water

                  early-stage eggs in their testes, and this feminization has
                  been attributed to the presence of estrogenic substances such
                  as natural estrogens [estrone or 17beta-estradiol (E2)], the
                  synthetic estrogen used in birth-control pills [17
                  alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2)], or weaker estrogen mimics such

                  (5-6 ng x L(-1)) of the potent 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol led
                  to feminization of males through the production of
                  vitellogenin mRNA and protein, impacts on gonadal development
                  as evidenced by intersex in males and altered oogenesis in

                  input file generation process, presenting a significant hurdle
                  for researchers without advanced computational expertise.
                  While AlphaFold Server comes with a user-friendly graphical
                  user interface, it supports only a subset of the features of
                  AlphaFold3. To address this, we present af3cli, an open-source

                  files, specifically tailored to the standalone version of

                  However, despite more than 50 y of research, the molecular
                  basis for the role of OmpA has remained elusive. In this

                  Using gene fusions, atomic force microscopy, simulations, and

                  the β-barrel and CW-binding domains are necessary to enhance

                  membrane proteins has been complicated by their extensive
                  hydrophobic surfaces, which can make production and structural
                  characterization difficult. Here we describe a general deep
                  learning-based design approach for solubilizing native
                  membrane proteins while preserving their sequence, fold, and
                  function using genetically encoded de novo protein WRAPs
                  (Water-soluble RFdiffused Amphipathic Proteins) that surround
                  the lipid-interacting hydrophobic surfaces, rendering them
                  stable and water-soluble without the need for detergents. We
                  design WRAPs for both beta-barrel outer membrane and helical
                  multi-pass transmembrane proteins, and show that the
                  solubilized proteins retain the binding and enzymatic
                  functions of the native targets with enhanced stability.
                  Syphilis vaccine development has been hindered by difficulties
                  in characterizing and producing the outer membrane protein
                  antigens; we generated soluble versions of four Treponema
                  pallidum outer membrane beta barrels which are potential
                  syphilis vaccine antigens. A 4.0 angstrom cryo-EM map of
                  WRAPed TP0698 is closely consistent with the design model.
                  WRAPs should be broadly useful for facilitating biochemical
                  and structural characterization of integral membrane proteins,
                  enabling therapeutic discovery by screening against purified
                  soluble targets, and generating antigenically intact
                  immunogens for vaccine development.}

                  thereby function as inhibitors and regulatory elements.
                  Peptide fragments of larger proteins are particularly
                  attractive for achieving these functions due to their inherent
                  potential to form native-like binding interactions. Recently
                  developed experimental approaches allow for high-throughput
                  measurement of protein fragment inhibitory activity in living
                  cells. However, it has thus far not been possible to predict
                  de novo which of the many possible protein fragments bind to
                  protein targets, let alone act as inhibitors. We have
                  developed a computational method, FragFold, that employs
                  AlphaFold to predict protein fragment binding to full-length
                  proteins in a high-throughput manner. Applying FragFold to
                  thousands of fragments tiling across diverse proteins revealed
                  peaks of predicted binding along each protein sequence.
                  Comparisons with experimental measurements establish that our
                  approach is a sensitive predictor of fragment function:
                  Evaluating inhibitory fragments from known protein-protein
                  interaction interfaces, we find 87\% are predicted by FragFold
                  to bind in a native-like mode. Across full protein sequences,
                  68\% of FragFold-predicted binding peaks match experimentally
                  measured inhibitory peaks. Deep mutational scanning
                  experiments support the predicted binding modes and uncover
                  superior inhibitory peptides in high throughput. Further,
                  FragFold is able to predict previously unknown protein binding
                  modes, explaining prior genetic and biochemical data. The
                  success rate of FragFold demonstrates that this computational
                  approach should be broadly applicable for discovering
                  inhibitory protein fragments across proteomes.},

                  binders, designing proteins that bind with high affinity to
                  polar protein targets remains an outstanding problem. Here we
                  show that RFdiffusion can be conditioned to efficiently
                  generate protein scaffolds that form geometrically matched
                  extended beta-sheets with target protein edge beta-strands in
                  which polar groups on the target are nearly perfectly
                  complemented with hydrogen bonding groups on the design. We
                  use this approach to design binders against a set of
                  therapeutically relevant polar targets (KIT, PDGFRɑ, ALK-2,
                  ALK-3, FCRL5, and NRP1) and find that beta-strand-targeted
                  design yields higher affinities and success rates than
                  unconditioned RFdiffusion. All by all binding experiments show
                  that the designs have affinities ranging from 137 pM to mid nM
                  for their targets and essentially no off target binding
                  despite the sharing of beta-strand interactions, likely
                  reflecting the precise customization of interacting
                  beta-strand geometry and additional designed binder-target
                  interactions. A co-crystal structure of one such design in
                  complex with the KIT receptor is nearly identical to the
                  computational design model confirming the accuracy of the
                  design approach. The ability to robustly generate binders
                  displaying high affinity and specificity to polar interaction
                  surfaces with exposed beta-strands considerably increases the
                  range and capabilities of computational binder design.}

                  cancer risk. Yet emerging clinical and experimental evidence
                  points to progestogens [endogenous progesterone or synthetic
                  progesterone (progestin)] as the primary hormonal driver
                  underlying seemingly estrogen-associated breast cancer risk.
                  Estrogens may contribute to breast cancer risk indirectly by
                  induction of the progesterone receptor and thus amplifying
                  progesterone signaling. Large studies of hormonal
                  contraceptives suggest that the small increase in breast
                  cancer risk from hormonal contraceptives is mainly
                  attributable to progestins, not estrogens.
                  Estrogen-plus-progestin hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has
                  consistently shown an increase in breast cancer risk among
                  postmenopausal women, whereas estrogen-alone HRT has little
                  impact on breast cancer risk in naturally or surgically
                  menopausal women. In particular, the long-term follow-up of
                  the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized trials suggests
                  a benefit of estrogen alone. Recent data further indicate that
                  endogenously elevated estrogen during assisted reproductive
                  technology (ART) exhibits little adverse effect on or
                  potentially a reduction in breast cancer risk and recurrence.
                  Also, accumulating evidence suggests that inhibition of
                  progesterone signaling is a critical mechanism underlying the
                  risk-reducing and therapeutic effects of antiestrogens.
                  Estrogen HRT has shown an array of proven benefits, including
                  ameliorating menopausal symptoms and improving bone health.
                  Collective evidence thus suggests that estrogen HRT is likely
                  to offer health benefits to perimenopausal or postmenopausal
                  women, including breast cancer survivors, as well as young

                  to develop muscle strength and mass to improve sports
                  performance. Massive doping is a worldwide public health issue
                  insufficiently known by physicians in general and by
                  endocrinologists in particular. Yet, its prevalence, probably
                  underestimated, would be between 1 and 5\% at the
                  international level. Numerous deleterious effects associated
                  with A/AS abuse have been identified: inhibition of the
                  gonadotropic axis responsible for hypogonadotropic
                  hypogonadism and infertility in men, and masculinization
                  (defeminization), hirsutism and anovulation in women.
                  Metabolic (very low HDL cholesterol), hematological
                  (polycythemia), psychiatric, cardiovascular and hepatic
                  complications have also been documented. As a result,
                  anti-doping agencies have developed increasingly effective
                  techniques for detecting A/AS, both to identify and punish
                  cheating athletes and to protect the health of the greatest
                  number of them. These techniques use a combination of liquid
                  and gas chromatographic methods coupled with mass
                  spectrometry, known respectively by the acronyms LC-MS and
                  GC-MS. These detection tools have a remarkable sensitivity and
                  specificity to detect natural steroids and synthetic A/AS of
                  known structure. Furthermore, by distinguishing isotopes, it
                  is also possible to distinguish natural endogenous hormones,
                  testosterone and androgenic precursors from those administered
                  for doping purposes. For elite athletes, a "biological
                  passport" has also been introduced. It consists of monitoring
                  the evolution of steroids and their metabolites, as well as
                  other biological parameters in the blood and urine over time
                  after having established a basal state athlete signature,
                  established, a priori, without doping. Better training of
                  health professionals, general practitioners and specialists
                  should be a priority for academic institutions and medical
                  societies. It would provide them with better knowledge of the
                  populations at risk and the clinical and biological semiology
                  of male and female doping, including withdrawal syndrome
                  associated with anxiety and depression following cessation of
                  chronic A/AS use. The ultimate goal is to provide these
                  physicians with the keys to treating these patients while
                  combining medical rigor and empathy. These points will be

                  form of nanopore DNA sequencing utilizes the hypothesis that
                  individual nucleotides of single-stranded DNA passing through
                  a nanopore will uniquely modulate an ionic current flowing
                  through the pore, allowing the record of the current to yield
                  the DNA sequence. We demonstrate that the ionic current
                  through the engineered Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A, MspA,
                  has the ability to distinguish all four DNA nucleotides and
                  resolve single-nucleotides in single-stranded DNA when
                  double-stranded DNA temporarily holds the nucleotides in the

                  double-stranded sections through MspA provides proof of

                  These findings highlight the importance of MspA in the future

                  and complexes. FastDesign has been used previously to design
                  novel protein folds and assemblies with important applications
                  in research and medicine. To promote sampling of alternative

                  our understanding of the physiochemical principles that govern
                  molecular recognition. Attempts to rationally design
                  ligand-binding proteins have met with little success, however,
                  and the computational design of protein-small-molecule
                  interfaces remains an unsolved problem. Current approaches for
                  designing ligand-binding proteins for medical and
                  biotechnological uses rely on raising antibodies against a
                  target antigen in immunized animals and/or performing
                  laboratory-directed evolution of proteins with an existing low
                  affinity for the desired ligand, neither of which allows
                  complete control over the interactions involved in binding.
                  Here we describe a general computational method for designing
                  pre-organized and shape complementary small-molecule-binding
                  sites, and use it to generate protein binders to the steroid
                  digoxigenin (DIG). Of seventeen experimentally characterized
                  designs, two bind DIG; the model of the higher affinity binder
                  has the most energetically favourable and pre-organized
                  interface in the design set. A comprehensive binding-fitness
                  landscape of this design, generated by library selections and
                  deep sequencing, was used to optimize its binding affinity to
                  a picomolar level, and X-ray co-crystal structures of two
                  variants show atomic-level agreement with the corresponding
                  computational models. The optimized binder is selective for
                  DIG over the related steroids digitoxigenin, progesterone and
                  β-oestradiol, and this steroid binding preference can be
                  reprogrammed by manipulation of explicitly designed
                  hydrogen-bonding interactions. The computational design method
                  presented here should enable the development of a new

                  AF2BIND uses 20 “bait” amino acids to optimally extract the

                  when completely folded, not all conflicting interactions have
                  been resolved so the structure remains "locally frustrated".

                  targeting biological L-proteins is a valuable area of
                  research. To design these structuresin silico, a computational
                  workflow should correctly dock and fold a peptide while
                  maintaining chiral centers. The latest AlphaFold 3 (AF3) from
                  Abramson et al. (2024) enforces a strict chiral violation
                  penalty to maintain chiral centers from model inputs and is
                  reported to have a low chiral violation rate of only 4.4\% on
                  a PoseBusters benchmark containing diverse chiral molecules.
                  Herein, we report the results of 3,255 experiments with AF3 to
                  evaluate its ability to predict the fold, chirality, and
                  binding pose of D-peptides in heterochiral complexes. Despite
                  our inputs specifying explicit D-stereocenters, we report that
                  the AF3 chiral violation for D-peptide binders is much higher
                  at 51\% across all evaluated predictions; on average the model
                  is as accurate as chance (random chirality choice, L or D, for
                  each peptide residue). Increasing the number of seeds failed
                  to improve this violation rate. The AF3 predictions exhibit
                  incorrect folds and binding poses, with D-peptides commonly
                  oriented incorrectly in the L-protein binding pocket.
                  Confidence metrics returned by AF3 also fail to distinguish
                  predictions with low chirality violation and correct docking
                  vs. predictions with high chirality violation and incorrect
                  docking. We conclude that AF3 is a poor predictor of D-peptide

                  landscape of a protein and its dynamic flexibility remains
                  challenging. In this work, we developed Modal-aligned
                  conditional Diffusion (Mac-Diff), a score based diffusion
                  model for generating the conformational ensembles for unseen
                  proteins. Central to Mac-Diff is an innovative attention
                  module that enforces a delicate, locality-aware alignment
                  between the conditional view (protein sequence) and the target
                  view (residue pair geometry) to compute highly contextualized
                  features for effective structural denoising. Furthermore,
                  Mac-Diff leverages semantically rich sequence embedding from
                  Protein Language Models like ESM-2 in enforcing the protein
                  sequence condition that captures evolutionary, structural and
                  functional information. This compensates for protein
                  structural heterogeneity more effectively than embeddings from
                  structure prediction models that are possibly biased to the
                  dominant conformation. Mac-Diff showed promising results in
                  generating realistic and diverse protein structures. It
                  successfully recovered conformational distributions of fast

                  pioneered by AlphaFold, the existing PSCP methods still rely
                  on experimental inputs, and do not leverage
                  AlphaFold-predicted backbone coordinates to enable PSCP at
                  scale. Results: Here, we perform a large-scale benchmarking of
                  the predictive performance of various PSCP methods on public
                  datasets from multiple rounds of the Critical Assessment of
                  Structure Prediction (CASP) challenges using a diverse set of
                  evaluation metrics. Empirical results demonstrate that the
                  PSCP methods perform well in packing the side-chains with
                  experimental inputs, but they fail to generalize in repacking
                  AlphaFold-generated structures. We additionally explore the

                  scores from AlphaFold by implementing a backbone

                  often leads to performance improvement by attaining modest yet
                  statistically significant accuracy gains over the AlphaFold

                  combinatorial rules that govern cell-type-specific activities
                  of enhancers. These models function as biological ‘oracles’,
                  capable of accurately predicting the activity of novel DNA
                  sequences. By leveraging these oracles, DNA sequences can be

                  diverse protein family and are targets for a broad spectrum of
                  pharmaceuticals. Technological progress in X-ray
                  crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy has enabled
                  extensive, high-resolution structural characterisation of
                  GPCRs in different conformational states. However, as highly
                  dynamic events underlie GPCR signalling, a complete
                  understanding of GPCR functionality requires insights into
                  their conformational dynamics. Here, we present a large
                  dataset of molecular dynamics simulations covering 60\% of
                  currently available GPCR structures. Our analysis reveals
                  extensive local "breathing" motions of the receptor on a nano-
                  to microsecond timescale and provides access to numerous
                  previously unexplored receptor conformational states.
                  Furthermore, we reveal that receptor flexibility impacts the
                  shape of allosteric drug binding sites, which frequently adopt
                  partially or completely closed states in the absence of a
                  molecular modulator. We demonstrate that exploring membrane
                  lipid dynamics and their interaction with GPCRs is an
                  efficient approach to expose such hidden allosteric sites and
                  even lateral ligand entrance gateways. The obtained insights

                  Proteolytic cleavage of the main structural polyprotein Gag
                  into functional domains induces rearrangement into mature,
                  infectious virions. In immature virus particles, the Gag
                  membrane-binding domain, MA, forms a hexameric protein lattice
                  that undergoes structural transition, following cleavage, into
                  a distinct, mature MA lattice1. The mechanism of MA lattice
                  maturation is unknown. Here we show that released spacer
                  peptide 2 (SP2), a conserved peptide of unknown function
                  situated about 300 residues downstream of MA, binds MA to
                  induce structural maturation. By high-resolution in-virus
                  structure determination of MA, we show that MA does not bind
                  lipid into a side pocket as previously thought1, but instead
                  binds SP2 as an integral part of the protein-protein
                  interfaces that stabilize the mature lattice. Analysis of Gag
                  cleavage site mutants showed that SP2 release is required for
                  MA maturation, and we demonstrate that SP2 is sufficient to
                  induce maturation of purified MA on lipid monolayers in vitro.
                  SP2-triggered MA maturation correlated with faster fusion of
                  virus with target cells. Our results reveal a new, unexpected
                  interaction between two HIV-1 components, provide a
                  high-resolution structure of mature MA, establish the trigger

                  paths. We build a measure of academic success on the citation

                  protein complex formation, while antagonists prevent G protein

                  recessive disorders encompassing enzyme deficiencies in the
                  adrenal steroidogenesis pathway that lead to impaired cortisol
                  biosynthesis. Depending on the type and severity of steroid
                  block, patients can have various alterations in
                  glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and sex steroid production
                  that require hormone replacement therapy. Presentations vary
                  from neonatal salt wasting and atypical genitalia, to adult
                  presentation of hirsutism and irregular menses. Screening of
                  neonates with elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations
                  for classic (severe) 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the most
                  common type of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, is in place in
                  many countries, however cosyntropin stimulation testing might
                  be needed to confirm the diagnosis or establish non-classic
                  (milder) subtypes. Challenges in the treatment of congenital
                  adrenal hyperplasia include avoidance of glucocorticoid
                  overtreatment and control of sex hormone imbalances. Long-term
                  complications include abnormal growth and development, adverse
                  effects on bone and the cardiovascular system, and
                  infertility. Novel treatments aim to reduce glucocorticoid
                  exposure, improve excess hormone control, and mimic

                  proteins with diverse functionalities that are not found in
                  nature. Despite recent advances, experimental success rates
                  remain inconsistent and context-dependent, posing a bottleneck
                  for broader applications of de novo design. To overcome this,
                  structure and sequence prediction models have been applied to
                  assess design quality prior to experimental testing to save
                  time and resources. In this study, we aimed to determine the
                  extent to which AlphaFold2, Protein MPNN, and ESMFold can
                  discriminate between experimentally successful and
                  unsuccessful designs. For this, we curated a benchmark dataset
                  of 614 experimentally characterized de novo designed monomers
                  from 11 different design studies between 2012 and 2021. All
                  predictive models demonstrated moderate ability to
                  discriminate experimental successes (expressed, soluble,
                  monomeric, and fold into the intended design structure) from
                  failures, with many failed designs having better confidence
                  metrics than successful designs. Among all computational
                  models evaluated, ESMFold average pLDDT yielded the best
                  individual performance at distinguishing between successful
                  and unsuccessful designs. A logistic regression model
                  combining all confidence metrics provided only modest
                  improvement over ESMFold pLDDT alone. Overall, these results
                  show that these models can serve as an initial filtering
                  strategy prior to experimental validation; however, their
                  utility at accurately predicting experimental successful
                  designs remains limited without task-specific training.}

                  prevention and treatment. Synthetic immunology can provide
                  such strategies by applying engineering principles from
                  synthetic biology to immunology. Synthetic biologists engineer
                  cells by top-down genetic manipulation or bottom-up assembly

                  immunology approach. However, genetic immune engineering is
                  mostly limited to ex vivo applications and is subject to
                  complex counter-regulation inherent to immune functions.
                  Bottom-up synthetic biology can harness the rich

                  the content of science improvements on what came before? This
                  is the question of scientific progress. One answer is that
                  progress occurs when scientific theories “get closer to the
                  truth,” i.e., increase their degree of truthlikeness. A second
                  answer is that progress consists in increasing theories'
                  effectiveness for solving scientific problems. A third answer
                  is that progress occurs when the stock of scientific knowledge

                  progress consists in increasing scientific understanding,i.e.,
                  the capacity to correctly explain and reliably predict

                  substantially advance bioengineering, medicine, and the
                  chemical industry. Despite recent breakthroughs in protein
                  design and structure prediction, designing biocatalysts with
                  activities rivaling those of natural enzymes remains
                  challenging. Here, we present AI.zymes, a modular platform
                  integrating cutting-edge protein engineering algorithms within
                  an evolutionary framework. By combining programs such as
                  Rosetta, ESMFold, ProteinMPNN, and FieldTools in iterative
                  rounds of design and selection, AI.zymes optimizes a broad
                  range of catalytically relevant properties, such as transition
                  state affinity and protein stability. Notably, AI.zymes can
                  also improve properties that are not targeted by the employed
                  design algorithms. For instance, AI.zymes enhanced
                  electrostatic catalysis by iteratively selecting variants with
                  stronger catalytic electric fields. AI.zymes was benchmarked
                  by improving the promiscuous Kemp eliminase activity of
                  ketosteroid isomerase, yielding a 7.7-fold increase in
                  activity after zero-shot experimental validation of only 7
                  variants. Due to its modularity, AI.zymes can readily
                  incorporate emerging design algorithms, paving the way for a
                  unifying framework for enzyme design.},

               approaches are typically restricted to generating proteins with
               only static target properties, such as motifs and symmetries. In
               this work, we take a step towards overcoming this limitation by
               proposing a framework to condition structure generation on
               flexibility, which is crucial for key functionalities such as
               catalysis or molecular recognition. We first introduce BackFlip,
               an equivariant neural network for predicting per-residue
               flexibility from an input backbone structure. Relying on
               BackFlip, we propose FliPS, an SE(3)-equivariant conditional flow
               matching model that solves the inverse problem, that is,
               generating backbones that display a target flexibility profile.
               In our experiments, we show that FliPS is able to generate novel
               and diverse protein backbones with the desired flexibility,
               verified by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. FliPS and

              of straw, rather than sturdy houses of brick" (Kaelin Jr). In

              Despite repeated insistence from experts that sharing AI training
              data, code, and model weights-the saved parameters required to
              make new predictions-are necessary best practices, they are not
              universal practices among authors or publishers. A mere 10\% of

              abysmal status quo needs to be changed. Experimental biology

              macromolecular structure data in the Protein Data Bank was

              the importance of mandatory data deposition led to the creation of
              policies and their subsequent uptake at journals. Likewise,
              genomics researchers pioneered data sharing principles that guided
              funding agency policies. The scientific community must show
              similar resolve in establishing and uniformly applying policies

                  antibodies (Abs). To mimic the immunological process of BCR
                  selection during affinity maturation in germinal centers
                  (GCs), we performed deep mutational scanning on anti-S1
                  molecular Fabs using yeast display coupled to
                  fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Focusing only on changes
                  in affinity upon mutation, we found that human Ab development
                  pathways have few mutations which impart changes in monovalent
                  binding dissociation constants and that these mutations can
                  occur in nearly any order. Maturation pathways of two bnAbs
                  showed that while they are only slightly less permissible than
                  subtype-specific Abs, more development steps on average are
                  needed to reach the same level of affinity. Many of the
                  subtype-specific Abs had inherent affinity for antigen, and
                  these results were robust against different potential inferred
                  precursor sequences. To evaluate the effect of differential
                  affinity for precursors on GC outcomes, we adapted a
                  coarse-grained affinity maturation model. This model showed
                  that antibody precursors with minimal affinity advantages

                  complexes organize chromosomes. While most prokaryotes have

                  II, cohesin, and SMC5/6), shaping their considerably larger
                  genomes. Although essential, SMC complexes differ among model
                  eukaryotes, suggesting underexplored diversity. Here, we
                  reconstruct eukaryotic SMC complex evolution, revealing that
                  the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) had all four
                  complexes, supporting a sophisticated LECA. Subsequently,
                  condensin II was lost at least 30 times, making it one of the
                  most frequently lost eukaryotic machineries. Moreover,
                  multiple SMC complex components are more ancient and

                  common diffusion channels, predominantly monomeric/trimeric in

                  architecture, forming a pentameric porin-like superstructure.
                  Our X-ray and cryo-EM structures reveal a bowl-shape composite
                  outer β-wall, which houses a central chamber that encloses a
                  section of the lipid bilayer. We demonstrate that PopA,
                  reported to insert into prey inner membrane, causes defects

                  widespread PopA homologues, including likely tetramers and

                  similar prediction performance has been a long-standing
                  challenge. By combining recent deep-learning methods with a
                  large and diverse training set of all-atom protein
                  simulations, we here develop a bottom-up CG force field with
                  chemical transferability, which can be used for extrapolative
                  molecular dynamics on new sequences not used during model
                  parameterization. We demonstrate that the model successfully
                  predicts metastable states of folded, unfolded and
                  intermediate structures, the fluctuations of intrinsically
                  disordered proteins and relative folding free energies of
                  protein mutants, while being several orders of magnitude
                  faster than an all-atom model. This showcases the feasibility
                  of a universal and computationally efficient machine-learned
                  CG model for proteins.},

                  While discrete diffusion models have demonstrated strong
                  performance, existing methods often apply uniform denoising
                  across residues, overlooking position-specific uncertainty. We
                  propose an uncertainty-aware discrete denoising diffusion
                  model that employs a prior-posterior signaling mechanism to
                  dynamically guide the denoising process. Our approach further
                  integrates learned priors from a pretrained protein large
                  language model and a structure encoder within a modular
                  framework, jointly optimized through multi-objective training.
                  Across multiple benchmarks, our method achieves substantial
                  improvements over state-ofthe-art baselines, offering a
                  principled framework for structure-conditioned sequence
                  generation in proteins and beyond.}

                  (GNNs), for 3D applications such as protein structure
                  modelling. These hybrids typically involve either (1)
                  preprocessing/tokenizing structural features as input for
                  Transformers or (2) taking Transformer embeddings and
                  processing them within a structural representation. However,
                  there is evidence that Transformers can learn to process

                  a theoretical explanation for how Transformers can learn to

                  then validate this theory using both simulated 3D points and
                  in the context of masked token prediction for proteins.
                  Finally, we show that pre-training protein Transformer
                  encoders with structure improves performance on a downstream
                  task, yielding better performance than custom structural
                  models. Together, this work provides a basis for using

                  operate as black boxes, and their underlying working

                  protein language models (pLMs) and describe their potential in

                  decoder-only Transformer into four information contexts: (i)
                  training sequences, (ii) input prompt, (iii) model

                  can play in protein design: Evaluator, Multitasker, Engineer,
                  Coach, and Teacher, with the Evaluator role being the only one

                  discuss in detail how to enhance the sensitivity of analytical
                  procedures for the determination of female-steroid hormones
                  (estrogens and progestogens) in environmental matrices. Our
                  objective is to help the reader choose the best analytical
                  tool for sensitive, selective and fast determination of
                  estrogens and progestogens. A number of steps in the
                  analytical procedure, starting with the sample pre-treatment
                  and ending with detection, could significantly contribute to
                  enhancing sensitivity, so they need to be thoroughly
                  optimized.The best results in analysis of estrogens and
                  progestogens have been achieved with liquid chromatography
                  (LC), as separation method, and tandem mass spectrometry (MS),
                  as detection method, but we also discuss analysis using gas
                  chromatography coupled to MS. Sample preparation depends on
                  the kind of sample. Its optimization is important in reducing
                  matrix interferences and plays a significant role in enhancing
                  sensitivity. Liquid samples were most frequently prepared with
                  off-line solid-phase extraction, while solid samples were also
                  extracted by liquid-liquid, pressurized-liquid, microwave and
                  ultrasound extraction techniques. In several studies,
                  derivatization improved the sensitivity of LC-MS detection.},

                  for protein design, existing computational pipelines remain
                  rigid, highly specific, and ill-suited for tasks requiring
                  non-differentiable or multi-objective design goals. In this
                  report, we introduce BAGEL , a modular, open-source framework
                  for programmable protein engineering, enabling flexible
                  exploration of sequence space through model-agnostic and
                  gradient-free exploration of an energy landscape. BAGEL
                  formalizes protein design as the sampling of an energy
                  function, either to optimize (find a global optimum) or to
                  explore a basin of interest (generate diverse candidates).
                  This energy function is composed of user-defined terms
                  capturing geometric constraints, sequence embedding
                  similarities, or structural confidence metrics. BAGEL also
                  natively supports multi-state optimization and advanced Monte
                  Carlo techniques, providing researchers with a flexible
                  alternative to fixed-backbone and inverse-folding paradigms
                  common in current design workflows. Moreover, the package
                  seamlessly integrates a wide range of publicly available deep
                  learning protein models, allowing users to rapidly take full
                  advantage of any future improvements in model accuracy and
                  speed. We illustrate the versatility of BAGEL on four
                  archetypal applications: designing de novo peptide binders,
                  targeting intrinsically disordered epitopes, selectively
                  binding to species-specific variants, and generating enzyme
                  variants with conserved catalytic sites. By offering a
                  modular, easy-to-use platform to define custom protein design
                  objectives and optimization strategies, BAGEL aims to speed up
                  the design of new proteins. Our goal with its release is to
                  democratize protein design, abstracting the process as much as
                  possible from technical implementation details and thereby
                  making it more accessible to the broader scientific community,
                  unlocking untapped potential for innovation in biotechnology

                  detection of peptide biomarkers in complex mixtures of
                  molecules, such as biofluids, to enable early disease
                  detection. Moreover, to our knowledge, there is currently no
                  detection method capable of identifying the different
                  conformations of a peptide biomarker differing by a single
                  amino acid. Single-molecule nanopore sensing promises to
                  provide this level of resolution. In order to be able to
                  identify these differences in a biofluid such as serum, it is
                  necessary to carefully characterize electrical parameters to
                  obtain specific signatures of each biomarker population
                  observed. We are interested here in a family of peptide
                  biomarkers, kinins such as bradykinin and des-Arg9 bradykinin,
                  that are involved in many disabling pathologies (allergy,
                  asthma, angioedema, sepsis, or cancer). We show the proof of
                  concept for direct identification of these biomarkers in serum
                  at the single-molecule level using a protein nanopore. Each
                  peptide exhibits two unique electrical signatures attributed
                  to specific conformations in bulk. The same signatures are
                  found in serum, allowing their discrimination and
                  identification in a complex mixture such as biofluid. To
                  extend the utility of our experimental results, we developed a
                  principal component analysis approach to define the most
                  relevant electrical parameters for their identification.
                  Finally, we used semisupervised classification to assign each
                  event type to a specific biomarker at physiological serum
                  concentration. In the future, single-molecule scale analysis
                  of peptide biomarkers using a powerful nanopore coupled with
                  machine learning will facilitate the identification and
                  quantification of other clinically relevant biomarkers from
                  biofluids.},

                  Cell-Free Two-Hybrid (CF2H), a rapid and sensitive method for
                  detecting high-affinity protein-protein interactions (PPI)
                  that does not require cloning, protein purification nor
                  high-end laboratory equipment. CF2H uses a

                  and bait proteins to trigger transcription upon

                  inhibitor PD-L1 in less than 24 hours. Finally, we show that

                  accurately model their nanofluidic properties is currently
                  unavailable. This limits the rational engineering of nanopore
                  traits and makes the unambiguous interpretation of
                  experimental results challenging. Here, we present a continuum
                  approach that can faithfully reproduce the experimentally
                  measured ionic conductance of the biological nanopore
                  Cytolysin A (ClyA) over a wide range of ionic strengths and
                  bias potentials. Our model consists of the extended
                  Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Navier-Stokes (ePNP-NS) equations
                  and a computationally efficient 2D-axisymmetric representation
                  for the geometry and charge distribution of the nanopore.
                  Importantly, the ePNP-NS equations achieve this accuracy by
                  self-consistently considering the finite size of the ions and
                  the influence of both the ionic strength and the nanoscopic
                  scale of the pore on the local properties of the electrolyte.
                  These comprise the mobility and diffusivity of the ions, and
                  the density, viscosity and relative permittivity of the
                  solvent. Crucially, by applying our methodology to ClyA, a
                  biological nanopore used for single-molecule enzymology
                  studies, we could directly quantify several nanofluidic
                  characteristics difficult to determine experimentally. These
                  include the ion selectivity, the ion concentration
                  distributions, the electrostatic potential landscape, the
                  magnitude of the electro-osmotic flow field, and the internal
                  pressure distribution. Hence, this work provides a means to
                  obtain fundamental new insights into the nanofluidic

                  pathways. Part of their actions depends on their
                  transcription-regulating properties, exerted by highly
                  specific nuclear receptors which are hormone-dependent
                  transcription factors. Nuclear hormone receptors interact with
                  coactivators, corepressors, basal transcription factors, and
                  other transcription factors in order to modulate the activity
                  of target genes in a manner that is dependent on tissue, age
                  and developmental and pathophysiological states. The
                  biological effect of this mechanism becomes apparent not
                  earlier than 30-60 minutes after hormonal stimulus. In
                  addition, small-molecule hormones modify the function of the
                  cell by a number of nongenomic mechanisms, involving
                  interaction with proteins localized in the plasma membrane, in

                  cellular membranes and in nonnuclear cellular compartments.
                  The identity of such proteins is still under investigation;
                  however, it seems that extranuclear fractions of nuclear
                  hormone receptors commonly serve this function. A direct
                  interaction of small-molecule hormones with membrane
                  phospholipids and with mRNA is also postulated. In these

                  Biomarkers are critical to the rational development of medical
                  diagnostics and therapeutics, but significant confusion
                  persists regarding fundamental definitions and concepts
                  involved in their use in research and clinical practice.
                  Clarification of the definitions of different biomarker
                  classes and a better understanding of their appropriate
                  application could yield substantial benefits. Biomarker
                  definitions recently established in a joint FDA-NIH resource
                  place different classes of biomarkers in the context of their
                  respective uses in patient care, clinical research, or
                  therapeutic development. Complex composite biomarkers and
                  digital biomarkers derived from sensors and mobile
                  technologies, together with biomarker-driven predictive
                  toxicology and systems pharmacology, are reshaping development
                  of diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. An approach to
                  biomarker development that prioritizes the quality and
                  reproducibility of the science underlying biomarker
                  development and incorporates collaborative regulatory science
                  involving multiple disciplines will lead to rational,

                  linked to dynein and its cofactor dynactin has started to
                  emerge. Of particular importance for this process is a set of

                  joining is established and structural data showing eIF5B bound
                  to the full ribosome were obtained. To achieve its function,
                  eIF5B collaborates with eIF1A. However, structural data
                  illustrating how these two factors interact on the small
                  ribosomal subunit have long been awaited. The role of the
                  archaeal counterparts, aIF5B and aIF1A, remains to be
                  extensively addressed. Here, we study the late steps of
                  Pyrococcus abyssi translation initiation. Using in vitro
                  reconstituted initiation complexes and light scattering, we
                  show that aIF5B bound to GTP accelerates subunit joining

                  analyze domain movements associated to these two nucleotide

                  aIF5B and aIF1A at 2.7 Å resolution. Structural data shows how
                  archaeal 5B and 1A factors cooperate to induce a conformation
                  of the initiator tRNA favorable to subunit joining. Archaeal

                  revolutionary idea was borne out of the realization that a
                  large fraction of the extracellular matrix that holds
                  Gram-negative cells into a persistent biofilm is composed of
                  protein fibers (curli; tafi) with cross-β architecture,

                  diversity of protein molecules1, but the full potential of
                  proteins is likely to be much greater. Accessing this
                  potential has been challenging for both computation and
                  experiments because the space of possible protein molecules is
                  much larger than the space of those likely to have functions.
                  Here we introduce Chroma, a generative model for proteins and
                  protein complexes that can directly sample novel protein
                  structures and sequences, and that can be conditioned to steer
                  the generative process towards desired properties and
                  functions. To enable this, we introduce a diffusion process
                  that respects the conformational statistics of polymer
                  ensembles, an efficient neural architecture for molecular
                  systems that enables long-range reasoning with sub-quadratic
                  scaling, layers for efficiently synthesizing three-dimensional
                  structures of proteins from predicted inter-residue geometries
                  and a general low-temperature sampling algorithm for diffusion
                  models. Chroma achieves protein design as Bayesian inference
                  under external constraints, which can involve symmetries,
                  substructure, shape, semantics and even natural-language
                  prompts. The experimental characterization of 310 proteins
                  shows that sampling from Chroma results in proteins that are
                  highly expressed, fold and have favourable biophysical
                  properties. The crystal structures of two designed proteins

                  integral components of the dynein transport machinery, as they
                  recognize cargoes for cell cycle-specific transport and link
                  them to the motor complex. Human BicD2 switches from selecting
                  secretory and Golgi-derived vesicles for transport in G1 and S
                  phase (by recognizing Rab6GTP), to selecting the nucleus for
                  transport in G2 phase (by recognizing nuclear pore protein
                  Nup358), but the molecular mechanisms governing this switch
                  are elusive. Here, we have developed a quantitative model for
                  BicD2/cargo interactions that integrates affinities,
                  oligomeric states, and cellular concentrations of the
                  reactants. BicD2 and cargo form predominantly 2:2 complexes.
                  Furthermore, the affinity of BicD2 toward its cargo Nup358 is
                  higher than that toward Rab6GTP. Based on our calculations, an
                  estimated 1000 BicD2 molecules per cell would be recruited to
                  the nucleus through Nup358 in the absence of regulation.
                  Notably, RanGTP is a negative regulator of the Nup358/BicD2
                  interaction that weakens the affinity by a factor of 10 and
                  may play a role in averting dynein recruitment to the nucleus
                  outside of the G2 phase. However, our quantitative model
                  predicts that an additional negative regulator remains to be
                  identified. In the absence of negative regulation, the
                  affinity of Nup358 would likely be sufficient to recruit BicD2
                  to the nucleus in G2 phase. Our quantitative model makes
                  testable predictions of how cellular transport events are
                  orchestrated. These transport processes are important for
                  brain development, cell cycle control, signaling, and
                  neurotransmission at synapses.},

                  enabled the creation of novel proteins for a variety of
                  purposes. The capability for producing custom-shape
                  high-quality backbones for very large proteins would further
                  expand the scope of protein design. To this end, here we
                  introduce the AlphaFold2 (AF2) cycler (af2cycler) design
                  pipeline. AF2cycler is used to refine draft protein backbone
                  geometries of arbitrary shape created by the Chroma diffusion
                  model or other methods, using a combination of AF2 and
                  ProteinMPNN to achieve high designability with minimal
                  deviations from the initial target structure. In silico
                  testing on multiple protein designs (100-1000 amino acids)
                  demonstrated improvements in structural integrity and
                  designability after af2cycling confirmed by enhanced ESMFold
                  repredictions. Experimental wet lab validation through the
                  design of a variety of test proteins with distinct shapes,
                  each comprising 1000 amino acids, showed structural agreement
                  between in silico predictions and transmission electron
                  microscopy (TEM) imaging, establishing the af2cycler’s
                  efficacy in translating designs into real-world results.
                  Af2cycler provides a convenient and reliable protein design
                  workflow, particularly for large proteins, with potential for
                  expanding to applications in areas such as design of

                  language processing fine-tuning large language models has

                  supervised fine-tuning almost always improves downstream
                  predictions. Secondly, parameter-efficient fine-tuning can
                  reach similar improvements consuming substantially fewer
                  resources at up to 4.5-fold acceleration of training over
                  fine-tuning full models. Our results suggest to always try
                  fine-tuning, in particular for problems with small datasets,
                  such as for fitness landscape predictions of a single protein.

                  three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid
                  sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the
                  structure of a protein largely determines its function2;
                  however, protein structures can be difficult to determine
                  experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made
                  by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer
                  which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing
                  covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the
                  prediction of protein structures3. Here we show that we can
                  train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the
                  distances between pairs of residues, which convey more
                  information about the structure than contact predictions.
                  Using this information, we construct a potential of mean
                  force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We
                  find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple
                  gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without
                  complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named
                  AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with
                  fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment
                  of Protein Structure Prediction5 (CASP13)-a blind assessment
                  of the state of the field-AlphaFold created high-accuracy
                  structures (with template modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or
                  higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the
                  next best method, which used sampling and contact information,
                  achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains.
                  AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in
                  protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased
                  accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction
                  of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for
                  homologous proteins have been experimentally determined7.},

                  proteins using deep-learning methods1-9. Despite this
                  progress, a general deep-learning framework for protein design
                  that enables solution of a wide range of design challenges,
                  including de novo binder design and design of higher-order
                  symmetric architectures, has yet to be described. Diffusion
                  models10,11 have had considerable success in image and
                  language generative modelling but limited success when applied
                  to protein modelling, probably due to the complexity of
                  protein backbone geometry and sequence-structure
                  relationships. Here we show that by fine-tuning the
                  RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure
                  denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein
                  backbones that achieves outstanding performance on
                  unconditional and topology-constrained protein monomer design,
                  protein binder design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme
                  active site scaffolding and symmetric motif scaffolding for
                  therapeutic and metal-binding protein design. We demonstrate
                  the power and generality of the method, called RoseTTAFold
                  diffusion (RFdiffusion), by experimentally characterizing the
                  structures and functions of hundreds of designed symmetric
                  assemblies, metal-binding proteins and protein binders. The
                  accuracy of RFdiffusion is confirmed by the cryogenic electron
                  microscopy structure of a designed binder in complex with
                  influenza haemagglutinin that is nearly identical to the
                  design model. In a manner analogous to networks that produce
                  images from user-specified inputs, RFdiffusion enables the
                  design of diverse functional proteins from simple molecular
                  specifications.},

                  we combine deep learning and physics-based methods to generate
                  a family of proteins with diverse and designable pocket
                  geometries, which we employ to computationally design binders
                  for six chemically and structurally distinct small-molecule

                  revealed nanomolar to low micromolar binding affinities and
                  atomic-level design accuracy. The bound ligands are exposed at
                  one edge of the binding pocket, enabling the de novo design of

                  variety of imperfections. Although this fact has been pointed
                  out in the past, it is still worth periodic updates so that
                  the metadata obtained by global analysis of the available
                  crystal structures, as well as the utilization of the
                  individual structures for tasks such as drug design, should be
                  based on only the most reliable data. Here, selected abnormal
                  deposited structures have been analysed based on the Bayesian
                  reasoning that the correctness of a model must be judged
                  against both the primary evidence as well as prior knowledge.
                  These structures, as well as information gained from the
                  corresponding publications (if available), have emphasized
                  some of the most prevalent types of common problems. The
                  errors are often perfect illustrations of the nature of human
                  cognition, which is frequently influenced by preconceptions
                  that may lead to fanciful results in the absence of proper
                  validation. Common errors can be traced to negligence and a
                  lack of rigorous verification of the models against electron
                  density, creation of non-parsimonious models, generation of
                  improbable numbers, application of incorrect symmetry,
                  illogical presentation of the results, or violation of the
                  rules of chemistry and physics. Paying more attention to such
                  problems, not only in the final validation stages but during
                  the structure-determination process as well, is necessary not
                  only in order to maintain the highest possible quality of the
                  structural repositories and databases but most of all to
                  provide a solid basis for subsequent studies, including
                  large-scale data-mining projects. For many scientists PDB
                  deposition is a rather infrequent event, so the need for
                  proper training and supervision is emphasized, as well as the

                  absolutely necessary safeguarding measures against such
                  problems. Ways of identifying more problematic structures are
                  suggested so that their users may be properly alerted to their

                  In each case, dynein is recruited to the nuclear envelope (NE)
                  specifically during G2 via two nuclear pore-mediated
                  mechanisms involving RanBP2-BicD2 and Nup133-CENP-F. The

                  controller for NE dynein recruitment in neural stem cells and
                  HeLa cells. Cdk1 phosphorylates conserved sites within RanBP2

                  recruitment is triggered by a Cdk1-induced export of CENP-F

                  computational design because of their considerable functional
                  diversity despite their very small size (<70 amino acids).
                  However, there are considerable challenges to designing such
                  structures, and there has been little success thus far.
                  Because of the small size, the hydrophobic core stabilizing
                  the fold is necessarily very small, and the conformational
                  strain of barrel closure can oppose folding; also
                  intermolecular aggregation through free beta strand edges can
                  compete with proper monomer folding. Here, we explore the de
                  novo design of small beta barrel topologies using both Rosetta
                  energy-based methods and deep learning approaches to design
                  four small beta barrel folds: Src homology 3 (SH3) and
                  oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) topologies found
                  in nature and five and six up-and-down-stranded barrels rarely
                  if ever seen in nature. Both approaches yielded successful
                  designs with high thermal stability and experimentally
                  determined structures with less than 2.4 Å rmsd from the
                  designed models. Using deep learning for backbone generation
                  and Rosetta for sequence design yielded higher design success
                  rates and increased structural diversity than Rosetta alone.
                  The ability to design a large and structurally diverse set of
                  small beta barrel proteins greatly increases the protein shape

                  diseases characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of
                  hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Malignant cell
                  growth is characterized by disruption of normal intracellular
                  signaling, caused by mutations or aberrant external signaling.
                  The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mammalian target of
                  rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway) is among one
                  of the intracellular pathways aberrantly upregulated in
                  cancers including AML. Activation of this pathway seems
                  important in leukemogenesis, and given the central role of
                  this pathway in metabolism, the bioenergetics of AML cells may
                  depend on downstream signaling within this pathway.
                  Furthermore, observations suggest that constitutive activation
                  of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway differs between patients, and
                  that increased activity within this pathway is an adverse
                  prognostic parameter in AML. Pharmacological targeting of the
                  PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway with specific inhibitors results in
                  suppression of leukemic cell growth. However, AML patients
                  seem to differ regarding their susceptibility to various
                  small-molecule inhibitors, reflecting biological heterogeneity
                  in the intracellular signaling status. These findings should

                  settings, along with the potential use of this pathway as a
                  prognostic biomarker, both in patients receiving intensive
                  curative AML treatment and in elderly/unfit receiving

                  Ground-breaking research has centered around unraveling the
                  characteristics of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA)
                  and the nuanced archaeal and bacterial contributions in
                  eukaryogenesis, resulting in fundamental changes in our
                  understanding of the Tree of Life. The archaeal and bacterial
                  roles are covered by theories of endosymbiogenesis wherein an
                  ancestral host archaeon and a bacterial endosymbiont merged to
                  create a new complex cell type - Eukarya - and its
                  mitochondrion. Eukarya is often regarded as a unique and
                  distinct domain due to complex innovations not found in
                  archaea or bacteria, despite housing a chimeric genome
                  containing genes of both archaeal and bacterial origin.
                  However, the discovery of complex cell machineries in recently
                  described Asgard archaeal lineages, and the growing support
                  for diverse bacterial gene transfers prior to and during the
                  time of LECA, is redefining our understanding of
                  eukaryogenesis. Indeed, the uniqueness of Eukarya, as a
                  domain, is challenged. It is likely that many microbial

  abstract     = {Amyloid fibrils are best known as a product of human and
                  animal protein misfolding disorders, where amyloid formation
                  is associated with cytotoxicity and disease. It is now evident
                  that for some proteins, the amyloid state constitutes the
                  native structure and serves a functional role. These
                  functional amyloids are proving widespread in bacteria and
                  fungi, fulfilling diverse functions as structural components
                  in biofilms or spore coats, as toxins and surface-active
                  fibers, as epigenetic material, peptide reservoirs or adhesins
                  mediating binding to and internalization into host cells. In
                  this review, we will focus on the role of functional amyloids
                  in bacterial pathogenesis. The role of functional amyloids as
                  virulence factor is diverse but mostly indirect. Nevertheless,
                  functional amyloid pathways deserve consideration for the
                  acute and long-term effects of the infectious disease process
                  and may form valid antimicrobial targets.},

                  while disordered, and they may fold to structured
                  conformations on binding. Here we show that the cis/trans
                  isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds can have a pronounced
                  effect on the interactions of IDPs. By single-molecule
                  spectroscopy, we identify a conserved proline residue in NCBD
                  (the nuclear-coactivator binding domain of CBP) whose
                  cis/trans isomerization in the unbound state modulates the
                  association and dissociation rates with its binding partner,
                  ACTR. As a result, NCBD switches on a time scale of tens of
                  seconds between two populations that differ in their

                  enzyme active site annotation algorithm that fuses latent
                  enzyme representations from the Protein Language Model and 3D
                  structural encoder, and then aligns protein-level information
                  with the knowledge of enzymatic reactions using a multi-modal

                  Diffusion models10,11have had considerable success in image
                  and language generative modeling but limited success when
                  applied to protein modeling, likely due to the complexity of
                  protein backbone geometry and sequence-structure
                  relationships. Here we show that by fine tuning the
                  RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure
                  denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein

                  that give rise to neurons, glia, and adult stem cells during

                  apically using cytoplasmic dynein during G2, and undergo
                  mitosis at the ventricular surface. By live imaging of in
                  utero electroporated rat brain, we find that two distinct
                  G2-specific mechanisms for dynein nuclear pore recruitment are
                  essential for apical nuclear migration. The "RanBP2-BicD2" and

                  extending the approaches used in Global Distance Test (GDT)1

                  exploited to eliminate the inherent protein size dependence of
                  the previous scores and appropriately account for random
                  protein structure pairs. Second, rather than setting specific
                  distance cutoffs and calculating only the fractions with
                  errors below the cutoff, all residue pairs in
                  alignment/modeling are evaluated in the proposed score. For
                  comparison of various scoring functions, we have constructed a
                  large-scale benchmark set of structure templates for 1489
                  small to medium size proteins using the threading program

                  stronger correlation to the quality of the final full-length
                  models. The TM-score is further exploited as an assessment of
                  all 'new fold' targets in the recent CASP5 experiment and
                  shows a close coincidence with the results of human-expert
                  visual assessment. These data suggest that the TM-score is a

                  where predicted AlphaFold2 structures are embedded into the
                  membrane plane and a quality assessment (plausibility of the
                  membrane-embedded structure) is provided for each prediction
                  using geometrical evaluation. In this paper, we analyze how
                  AF2 has improved the structural coverage of membrane proteins
                  compared to earlier years when only experimental structures
                  were available, and high-throughput structure prediction was
                  greatly limited. We also evaluate how AF2 can be used to
                  search for (distant) homologs in highly diverse protein
                  families. By combining quality assessment and homology search,
                  we can pinpoint protein families where AF2 accuracy is still
                  limited, and experimental structure determination would be
                  desirable.},

                  co-activate protein kinase B (PKB, also named Akt) by binding

                  fluorescence anisotropy, NMR, and small angle x-ray-scattering
                  measurements to determine the affinities, molecular

                  trans-phosphorylation, hinder deactivation of PKB, and involve
                  PKB in a multi-protein complex, explaining the array of known

                  the labor-intensive production of heavy-atom derivatives and
                  seleno-methio-nyl substitutions. The native-SAD method is
                  particularly attractive for membrane proteins, which are
                  difficult to produce and often recalcitrant to grow into
                  decent-sized crystals. Native-SAD uses lower-energy X-rays to
                  enhance anomalous signals from sulfur or phospho-rus. However,
                  at lower energies, the scattering and absorption of air
                  contribute to the background noise, reduce the signals and are
                  thus adverse to native-SAD phasing. We have previously

                  anomalous diffraction data at 5 keV for two proteins:
                  thaumatin and the membrane protein TehA. Although anomalous
                  signals from each individual crystal are very weak, robust
                  anomalous signals are obtained from data assembled from
                  micrometre-sized crystals. The thaumatin structure was
                  determined from 15 microcrystals and the TehA structure from
                  18 microcrystals. These results demonstrate the usefulness of

                  broad range of sensing applications. Current engineering
                  approaches for nanopore sensors are limited to naturally
                  occurring channels, which provide suboptimal starting points.
                  By contrast, de novo protein design can in principle create an
                  unlimited number of new nanopores with any desired properties.
                  Here we describe a general approach to designing transmembrane
                  β-barrel pores with different diameters and pore geometries.
                  Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystallographic
                  characterization show that the designs are stably folded with
                  structures resembling those of the design models. The designs
                  have distinct conductances that correlate with their pore
                  diameter, ranging from 110 picosiemens (~0.5 nanometer pore
                  diameter) to 430 picosiemens (~1.1 nanometer pore diameter).
                  Our approach opens the door to the custom design of
                  transmembrane nanopores for sensing and sequencing
                  applications. Editor’s summary Beta-barrel proteins are simple
                  in structure but have complex requirements for the proper
                  folding and conduction of ions and small molecules across a
                  membrane. Berhanu et al. developed an approach to designing
                  beta-barrel proteins with a range of transmembrane strands and
                  geometries ranging from oval to square to triangular.
                  Important in their design is incorporating breaks in the
                  secondary structure to prevent aggregation and to facilitate
                  folding into the membrane. The authors showed that these
                  proteins conduct ions and have properties that will be
                  advantageous for applications in sensing. —Michael A. Funk}

                  find "good" amino acid sequences (i) that fold to a desired
                  "target" structure as a native conformation of lowest
                  accessible free energy and (ii) that will not simultaneously
                  fold to many other conformations of the same free energy?
                  Current protein designs often focus on helix propensities and
                  turns. We focus here on designing the hydrophobicity. For a
                  model of self-avoiding hydrophobic/polar chains on
                  two-dimensional square lattices, geometric proofs and
                  exhaustive enumerations show the following results. (i) The
                  strategy hydrophobic residues inside/polar residues outside is
                  not optimal. Placement of additional hydrophobic residues on
                  the surface is often necessary. (ii) To avoid unwanted
                  conformations, the designed sequence must have neither too
                  many nor too few hydrophobic residues. (iii) The computational
                  complexity of inverse folding appears to be in a different
                  class than folding: unlike the folding problem, the design
                  problem does not scale exponentially with chain length. Some
                  design strategies, described here for the lattice model,
                  produce good sequences and scale only linearly with chain

                  between protein and DNA, is often achieved by varying bases or
                  side chains coming off the DNA or protein backbone-for
                  example, the bases participating in Watson-Crick pairing in
                  the double helix, or the side chains contacting DNA in
                  TALEN-DNA complexes. By contrast, specificity of
                  protein-protein interactions usually involves backbone shape
                  complementarity1, which is less modular and hence harder to
                  generalize. Coiled-coil heterodimers are an exception, but the
                  restricted geometry of interactions across the heterodimer
                  interface (primarily at the heptad a and d positions2) limits
                  the number of orthogonal pairs that can be created simply by
                  varying side-chain interactions3,4. Here we show that
                  protein-protein interaction specificity can be achieved using
                  extensive and modular side-chain hydrogen-bond networks. We
                  used the Crick generating equations5 to produce millions of
                  four-helix backbones with varying degrees of supercoiling
                  around a central axis, identified those accommodating
                  extensive hydrogen-bond networks, and used Rosetta to connect
                  pairs of helices with short loops and to optimize the
                  remainder of the sequence. Of 97 such designs expressed in
                  Escherichia coli, 65 formed constitutive heterodimers, and the
                  crystal structures of four designs were in close agreement
                  with the computational models and confirmed the designed
                  hydrogen-bond networks. In cells, six heterodimers were fully
                  orthogonal, and in vitro-following mixing of 32 chains from 16
                  heterodimer designs, denaturation in 5 M guanidine
                  hydrochloride and reannealing-almost all of the interactions
                  observed by native mass spectrometry were between the designed
                  cognate pairs. The ability to design orthogonal protein
                  heterodimers should enable sophisticated protein-based control
                  logic for synthetic biology, and illustrates that nature has

                  structure prediction using deep neural networks to predict
                  inter-residue distances from amino acid sequences1-3. Here we
                  investigate whether the information captured by such networks
                  is sufficiently rich to generate new folded proteins with
                  sequences unrelated to those of the naturally occurring
                  proteins used in training the models. We generate random amino
                  acid sequences, and input them into the trRosetta structure
                  prediction network to predict starting residue-residue
                  distance maps, which, as expected, are quite featureless. We
                  then carry out Monte Carlo sampling in amino acid sequence
                  space, optimizing the contrast (Kullback-Leibler divergence)
                  between the inter-residue distance distributions predicted by
                  the network and background distributions averaged over all
                  proteins. Optimization from different random starting points
                  resulted in novel proteins spanning a wide range of sequences
                  and predicted structures. We obtained synthetic genes encoding
                  129 of the network-'hallucinated' sequences, and expressed and
                  purified the proteins in Escherichia coli; 27 of the proteins
                  yielded monodisperse species with circular dichroism spectra
                  consistent with the hallucinated structures. We determined the
                  three-dimensional structures of three of the hallucinated
                  proteins, two by X-ray crystallography and one by NMR, and
                  these closely matched the hallucinated models. Thus, deep
                  networks trained to predict native protein structures from
                  their sequences can be inverted to design new proteins, and
                  such networks and methods should contribute alongside
                  traditional physics-based models to the de novo design of
                  proteins with new functions.},

                  preorganizing histidine residues in buried hydrogen-bond

                  biological processes, yet it remains challenging to
                  predictively design this functionality de novo. Current
                  state-of-the-art computational design methods typically rely
                  on existing small molecule binding sites or protein scaffolds
                  with existing shape complementarity for a target ligand. Here
                  we introduce new methods that utilize pools of discrete
                  contacts between protein side chains and defined small
                  molecule ligand substructures (ligand fragments) observed in
                  the Protein Data Bank. We use the Rosetta Molecular Modeling
                  Suite to recombine protein side chains in these contact pools
                  to generate hundreds of thousands of energetically favorable
                  binding sites for a target ligand. These composite binding
                  sites are built into existing scaffold proteins matching the
                  intended binding site geometry with high accuracy. In
                  addition, we apply pools of side chain rotamers interacting

  abstract     = {Allosteric regulation of protein function is widespread in
                  biology, but is challenging for de novo protein design as it
                  requires the explicit design of multiple states with
                  comparable free energies. Here we explore the possibility of
                  designing switchable protein systems de novo, through the
                  modulation of competing inter- and intramolecular
                  interactions. We design a static, five-helix 'cage' with a
                  single interface that can interact either intramolecularly
                  with a terminal 'latch' helix or intermolecularly with a
                  peptide 'key'. Encoded on the latch are functional motifs for
                  binding, degradation or nuclear export that function only when
                  the key displaces the latch from the cage. We describe
                  orthogonal cage-key systems that function in vitro, in yeast
                  and in mammalian cells with up to 40-fold activation of
                  function by key. The ability to design switchable protein
                  functions that are controlled by induced conformational change
                  is a milestone for de novo protein design, and opens up new
                  avenues for synthetic biology and cell engineering.},

  abstract     = {AbstractWe describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF)
                  for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with
                  existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids,
                  and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical
                  molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens.
                  It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom
                  types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to
                  estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The
                  performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I,
                  74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized
                  structures, with a root‐mean‐square displacement of 0.26 Å,
                  which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field
                  (0.25 Å) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and
                  0.44 Å, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations
                  were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the
                  minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared
                  to MP2/6‐31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative
                  energies were 0.25 Å and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These
                  data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Å and
                  1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to
                  these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of
                  71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the
                  Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies
                  (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be
                  applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion,
                  making it suitable for rational drug design and database
                  searching. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 25:

                  Powerful analytical methods have identified thousands of
                  phosphorylation sites, but many of their functions remain to
                  be deciphered. A key to understanding the function of protein
                  phosphorylation is access to phosphorylated proteins, but this
                  is often challenging or impossible. Here we evolve an

                  the efficient incorporation of phosphoserine (pSer (1)) into

                  AlphaFold [1] model, the prediction of multi-chain protein
                  complexes remains a challenge in many cases. In this work, we
                  demonstrate that an AlphaFold model trained specifically for
                  multimeric inputs of known stoichiometry, which we call
                  AlphaFold-Multimer, significantly increases accuracy of

                  single-chain AlphaFold while maintaining high intra-chain
                  accuracy. On a benchmark dataset of 17 heterodimer proteins
                  without templates (introduced in [2]) we achieve at least
                  medium accuracy (DockQ [3] ≥ 0.49) on 13 targets and high
                  accuracy (DockQ ≥ 0.8) on 7 targets, compared to 9 targets of

                  4,446 recent protein complexes, from which we score all
                  non-redundant interfaces with low template identity. For
                  heteromeric interfaces we successfully predict the interface
                  (DockQ ≥ 0.23) in 70\% of cases, and produce high accuracy

                  are complicated by the multisubunit structure of RNA
                  polymerase and by its indispensability for cell growth.
                  Previously, mutant RNA polymerases have been produced by in
                  vitro assembly from isolated subunits or by in vivo assembly
                  upon overexpression of a single mutant subunit. Both
                  approaches can fail if the mutant subunit is toxic or

                  co-overexpression and in vivo assembly of RNA polymerase
                  subunits, and apply this method to characterize the role of
                  sequence insertions present in the Escherichia coli enzyme. We
                  find that co-overexpression of its subunits allows assembly of
                  an RNA polymerase lacking a 188-amino acid insertion in the
                  beta' subunit. Based on experiments with this and other mutant

  abstract     = {An essential requirement for theoretical protein structure
                  prediction is an energy function that can discriminate the
                  native from non-native protein conformations. To date most of
                  the energy functions used for this purpose have been extracted
                  from a statistical analysis of the protein structure database,
                  without explicit reference to the physical interactions
                  responsible for protein stability. The use of the statistical
                  functions has been supported by the widespread belief that
                  they are superior for such discrimination to physics-based
                  energy functions. An effective energy function which combined
                  the CHARMM vacuum potential with a Gaussian model for the
                  solvation free energy is tested for its ability to
                  discriminate the native structure of a protein from misfolded
                  conformations; the results are compared with those obtained
                  with the vacuum CHARMM potential. The test is performed on
                  several sets of misfolded structures prepared by others,
                  including sets of about 650 good decoys for six proteins, as
                  well as on misfolded structures of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2.
                  The vacuum CHARMM potential is successful in most cases when
                  energy minimized conformations are considered, but fails when
                  applied to structures relaxed by molecular dynamics. With the
                  effective energy function the native state is always more
                  stable than grossly misfolded conformations both in energy
                  minimized and molecular dynamics-relaxed structures. The
                  present results suggest that molecular mechanics
                  (physics-based) energy functions, complemented by a simple
                  model for the solvation free energy, should be tested for use
                  in the inverse folding problem, and supports their use in
                  studies of the effective energy surface of proteins in
                  solution. Moreover, the study suggests that the belief in the
                  superiority of statistical functions for these purposes may be
                  ill founded.}

  abstract     = {The state-of-the-art to assess the structural quality of
                  docking models is currently based on three related yet
                  independent quality measures: Fnat, LRMS, and iRMS as proposed
                  and standardized by CAPRI. These quality measures quantify
                  different aspects of the quality of a particular docking model
                  and need to be viewed together to reveal the true quality,
                  e.g. a model with relatively poor LRMS (>10Å) might still
                  qualify as 'acceptable' with a descent Fnat (>0.50) and iRMS
                  (<3.0Å). This is also the reason why the so called CAPRI
                  criteria for assessing the quality of docking models is
                  defined by applying various ad-hoc cutoffs on these measures
                  to classify a docking model into the four classes: Incorrect,
                  Acceptable, Medium, or High quality. This classification has
                  been useful in CAPRI, but since models are grouped in only
                  four bins it is also rather limiting, making it difficult to
                  rank models, correlate with scoring functions or use it as
                  target function in machine learning algorithms. Here, we
                  present DockQ, a continuous protein-protein docking model
                  quality measure derived by combining Fnat, LRMS, and iRMS to a
                  single score in the range [0, 1] that can be used to assess
                  the quality of protein docking models. By using DockQ on CAPRI
                  models it is possible to almost completely reproduce the
                  original CAPRI classification into Incorrect, Acceptable,
                  Medium and High quality. An average PPV of 94\% at 90\% Recall
                  demonstrating that there is no need to apply predefined ad-hoc
                  cutoffs to classify docking models. Since DockQ recapitulates
                  the CAPRI classification almost perfectly, it can be viewed as
                  a higher resolution version of the CAPRI classification,
                  making it possible to estimate model quality in a more
                  quantitative way using Z-scores or sum of top ranked models,
                  which has been so valuable for the CASP community. The
                  possibility to directly correlate a quality measure to a
                  scoring function has been crucial for the development of
                  scoring functions for protein structure prediction, and DockQ
                  should be useful in a similar development in the protein
                  docking field. DockQ is available at

                  bicistronic or multicistronic vectors, an internal ribosomal
                  entry site (IRES) has been widely used. Due to the large size
                  and difference in expression levels between genes before and
                  after IRES, however, a new strategy was required to replace
                  IRES. A self-cleaving 2A peptide could be a good candidate to
                  replace IRES because of its small size and high cleavage
                  efficiency between genes upstream and downstream of the 2A
                  peptide. Despite the advantages of the 2A peptides, its use is
                  not widespread because (i) there are no publicly available
                  cloning vectors harboring a 2A peptide gene and (ii)
                  comprehensive comparison of cleavage efficiency among various
                  2A peptides reported to date has not been performed in

                  we generated and the highest efficiency of the P2A peptide we

                  scaffolds1,2, but has been limited by a lack of suitable
                  protein structures and the complexity of native protein
                  sequence-structure relationships. Here we describe a
                  deep-learning-based 'family-wide hallucination' approach that
                  generates large numbers of idealized protein structures
                  containing diverse pocket shapes and designed sequences that
                  encode them. We use these scaffolds to design artificial
                  luciferases that selectively catalyse the oxidative
                  chemiluminescence of the synthetic luciferin substrates
                  diphenylterazine3 and 2-deoxycoelenterazine. The designed
                  active sites position an arginine guanidinium group adjacent
                  to an anion that develops during the reaction in a binding
                  pocket with high shape complementarity. For both luciferin
                  substrates, we obtain designed luciferases with high
                  selectivity; the most active of these is a small (13.9 kDa)
                  and thermostable (with a melting temperature higher than 95
                  °C) enzyme that has a catalytic efficiency on diphenylterazine
                  (kcat/Km = 106 M-1 s-1) comparable to that of native
                  luciferases, but a much higher substrate specificity. The
                  creation of highly active and specific biocatalysts from
                  scratch with broad applications in biomedicine is a key
                  milestone for computational enzyme design, and our approach

                  protein-design methodology. Nevertheless, most methods demand
                  expert intervention, limiting their widespread adoption. By
                  contrast, the PROSS algorithm for improving protein stability
                  and heterologous expression levels has been successfully
                  applied to a range of challenging enzymes and binding
                  proteins. Here, we benchmark the application of PROSS as a
                  stand-alone tool for protein scientists with no or limited
                  experience in modeling. Twelve laboratories from the Protein
                  Production and Purification Partnership in Europe (P4EU)
                  challenged the PROSS algorithm with 14 unrelated protein
                  targets without support from the PROSS developers. For each
                  target, up to six designs were evaluated for expression levels
                  and in some cases, for thermal stability and activity. In nine
                  targets, designs exhibited increased heterologous expression
                  levels either in prokaryotic and/or eukaryotic expression
                  systems under experimental conditions that were tailored for
                  each target protein. Furthermore, we observed increased
                  thermal stability in nine of ten tested targets. In two prime
                  examples, the human Stem Cell Factor (hSCF) and human
                  Cadherin-Like Domain (CLD12) from the RET receptor, the wild
                  type proteins were not expressible as soluble proteins in E.
                  coli, yet the PROSS designs exhibited high expression levels
                  in E. coli and HEK293 cells, respectively, and improved
                  thermal stability. We conclude that PROSS may improve
                  stability and expressibility in diverse cases, and that
                  improvement typically requires target-specific expression
                  conditions. This study demonstrates the strengths of
                  community-wide efforts to probe the generality of new methods
                  and recommends areas for future research to advance
                  practically useful algorithms for protein science.},

                  structural biology. Recently, approaches like alphafold have
                  achieved remarkable performance on this task by combining deep
                  learning techniques with coevolutionary data from multiple
                  sequence alignments of related protein sequences. The use of
                  coevolutionary information is critical to these models'
                  accuracy, and without it their predictive performance drops
                  considerably. In living cells, however, the 3D structure of a
                  protein is fully determined by its primary sequence and the
                  biophysical laws that cause it to fold into a low-energy
                  configuration. Thus, it should be possible to predict a
                  protein's structure from only its primary sequence by learning
                  an approximate biophysical energy function. We provide
                  evidence that alphafold has learned such an energy function,
                  and uses coevolution data to solve the global search problem
                  of finding a low-energy conformation. We demonstrate that

                  quality of candidate protein structures with state-of-the-art

                  the development of biosensors and reporters for cellular and
                  clinical applications1. However, the number of such switches
                  is limited, and reengineering them is challenging. Here we
                  show that a general class of protein-based biosensors can be
                  created by inverting the flow of information through de novo
                  designed protein switches in which the binding of a peptide
                  key triggers biological outputs of interest2. The designed
                  sensors are modular molecular devices with a closed dark state
                  and an open luminescent state; analyte binding drives the
                  switch from the closed to the open state. Because the sensor
                  is based on the thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to
                  sensor activation, only one target binding domain is required,
                  which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in
                  solution. We create biosensors that can sensitively detect the
                  anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2, the IgG1 Fc domain, the HER2
                  receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors
                  for cardiac troponin I and an anti-hepatitis B virus antibody
                  with the high sensitivity required to detect these molecules
                  clinically. Given the need for diagnostic tools to track the
                  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)3,
                  we used the approach to design sensors for the SARS-CoV-2
                  spike protein and antibodies against the membrane and
                  nucleocapsid proteins. The former, which incorporates a de
                  novo designed spike receptor binding domain (RBD) binder4, has
                  a limit of detection of 15 pM and a luminescence signal
                  50-fold higher than the background level. The modularity and
                  sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid
                  construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes, and
                  highlights the power of de novo protein design to create

                  profit from the availability of large amounts of 3D structures
                  in protein structure databases or from AlphaFold predictions.
                  Current binding site identification methods heavily rely on
                  graph neural networks (GNNs), usually designed to output
                  E(3)-equivariant predictions. Such methods turned out to be
                  very beneficial for physics-related tasks like binding energy
                  or motion trajectory prediction. However, the performance of
                  GNNs at binding site identification is still limited
                  potentially due to the lack of dedicated nodes that model
                  hidden geometric entities, such as binding pockets. In this

                  deacetylase HDAC4 is covalently modified by the

                  deacetylase activity. The ability of HDAC4 to self-aggregate
                  is a prerequisite for proper sumoylation in vivo.
                  Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) signalling,
                  which induces nuclear export, abrogates SUMO-1 modification of

                  an intact nuclear localization signal and is catalysed by the
                  nuclear pore complex (NPC) RanBP2 protein, a factor newly

                  sumoylation of HDAC4 takes place at the NPC and is coupled to

                  migration in the developing cerebral cortex involves
                  Nesprin-2, which recruits cytoplasmic dynein, kinesin, and
                  actin to the nuclear envelope (NE) in other cell types.
                  However, the relative importance of these interactions in
                  neurons has remained poorly understood. To address these
                  issues, we performed in utero electroporation into the
                  developing rat brain to interfere with Nesprin-2 function. We
                  find that an ∼100-kDa "mini" form of the ∼800-kDa Nesprin-2
                  protein, which binds dynein and kinesin, is sufficient,
                  remarkably, to support neuronal migration. In contrast to
                  dynein's role in forward nuclear migration in these cells, we

                  suggesting a novel role for the opposite-directed motor
                  proteins in regulating migration velocity. In contrast to
                  studies in fibroblasts, the actin-binding domain of Nesprin-2
                  was dispensable for neuronal migration. We find further that,
                  surprisingly, the motor proteins interact with Nesprin-2
                  through the dynein/kinesin "adaptor" BicD2, both in neurons
                  and in non-mitotic fibroblasts. Furthermore, mutation of the

                  exploits the use of multimeric protein constructs, namely,
                  polyproteins, to decrease the impact of nonspecific
                  interactions, to improve data accumulation, and to allow the
                  accommodation of benchmarking reference domains within the
                  construct. However, methods to generate such constructs are
                  either time- and labor-intensive or lack control over the
                  length or the domain sequence of the obtained construct. Here,
                  we describe an approach that addresses both of these
                  shortcomings that uses Gibson assembly (GA) to generate a
                  defined recombinant polyprotein rapidly using linker
                  sequences. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we
                  used GA to make a polyprotein composed of alternating domains
                  of I27 and TmCsp, (I27-TmCsp)3-I27)(GA), and showed the
                  mechanical fingerprint, mechanical strength, and pulling speed
                  dependence are the same as an analogous polyprotein
                  constructed using the classical approach. After this
                  benchmarking, we exploited this approach to facilitiate the
                  mechanical characterization of POTRA domain 2 of BamA from E.
                  coli (EcPOTRA2) by assembling the polyprotein
                  (I27-EcPOTRA2)3-I27(GA). We show that, as predicted from the α
                  + β topology, EcPOTRA2 domains are mechanically robust over a
                  wide range of pulling speeds. Furthermore, we identify a clear
                  correlation between mechanical robustness and brittleness for
                  a range of other α + β proteins that contain the structural
                  feature of proximal terminal β-strands in parallel geometry.
                  We thus demonstrate that the GA approach is a powerful tool,
                  as it circumvents the usual time- and labor-intensive
                  polyprotein production process and allows for rapid production
                  of new constructs for single-molecule studies. As shown for
                  EcPOTRA2, this approach allows the exploration of the
                  mechanical properties of a greater number of proteins and
                  their variants. This improves our understanding of the
                  relationship between structure and mechanical strength,
                  increasing our ability to design proteins with tailored
                  mechanical properties.},

                  cultivation media) are considered among the three main
                  elements contributing to a successful production of
                  recombinant proteins. Accordingly, one of the most common
                  hosts to produce recombinant therapeutic proteins is
                  Escherichia coli. METHODOLOGY: A comprehensive literature
                  review was performed to identify important factors affecting
                  production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli.
                  RESULTS: Escherichia coli is taken into account as the
                  easiest, quickest, and cheapest host with a fully known
                  genome. Thus, numerous modifications have been carried out on
                  Escherichia coli to optimize it as a good candidate for
                  protein expression and; as a result, several engineered
                  strains of Escherichia coli have been designed. In general;
                  host strain, vector, and cultivation parameters are recognized
                  as crucial ones determining success of recombinant protein
                  expression in Escherichia coli. In this review, the role of
                  host, vector, and culture conditions along with current pros
                  and cons of different types of these factors leading to
                  success of recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli
                  were discussed. CONCLUSION: Successful protein expression in
                  Escherichia coli necessitates a broad knowledge about
                  physicochemical properties of recombinant proteins, selection
                  among common strains of Escherichia coli and vectors, as well
                  as factors related to media including time, temperature, and

                  and microtubule organization. Furthermore, dynein plays
                  essential roles during cell division where it is implicated in
                  multiple processes including centrosome separation, chromosome
                  movements, spindle organization, spindle positioning, and
                  mitotic checkpoint silencing. How is a single motor able to
                  fulfill this large array of functions and how are these
                  activities temporally and spatially regulated? The answer lies
                  in the unique composition of the dynein motor and in the
                  interactions it makes with multiple regulatory proteins that
                  define the time and place where dynein becomes active. Here,

                  is involved in, and how its regulatory proteins act to support
                  dynein. Although dynein is highly conserved amongst eukaryotes
                  (with the exception of plants), there is significant
                  variability in the cellular processes that depend on dynein in
                  different species. In this review, we concentrate on the
                  functions of cytoplasmic dynein in mammals but will also refer
                  to data obtained in other model organisms that have

                  NMR is particularly well-suited for determining dynamic
                  features of biomolecular structures. The conventional process
                  for determining biomolecular structures from experimental NMR
                  data involves its representation as conformation-dependent
                  restraints, followed by generation of structural models guided
                  by these spatial restraints. Here we describe an alternative
                  approach: generating a distribution of realistic protein
                  conformational models using artificial intelligence-(AI-)
                  based methods and then selecting the sets of conformers that
                  best explain the experimental data. We applied this
                  conformational selection approach to redetermine the solution
                  NMR structure of the enzyme Gaussia luciferase. First, we
                  generated a diverse set of conformer models using AlphaFold2
                  (AF2) with an enhanced sampling protocol. The models that
                  best-fit NOESY and chemical shift data were then selected with
                  a Bayesian scoring metric. The resulting models include
                  features of both the published NMR structure and the standard
                  AF2 model generated without enhanced sampling. This
                  "AlphaFold-NMR" protocol also generated an alternative "open"
                  conformational state that fits nearly as well to the overall
                  NMR data but accounts for some NOESY data that is not
                  consistent with first "closed" conformational state; while
                  other NOESY data consistent with this second state are not
                  consistent with the first conformational state. The structure
                  of this "open" structural state differs from that of the
                  "closed" state primarily by the position of a thumb-shaped
                  loop between α-helices H5 and H6, revealing a cryptic surface
                  pocket. These alternative conformational states of Gluc are
                  supported by "double recall" analysis of NOESY data and AF2
                  models. Additional structural states are also indicated by
                  backbone chemical shift data indicating partially-disordered
                  conformations for the C-terminal segment. Considered as a
                  multistate ensemble, these multiple states of Gluc together
                  fit the NOESY and chemical shift data better than the
                  "restraint-based" NMR structure and provide novel insights
                  into its structure-dynamic-function relationships. This study
                  demonstrates the potential of AI-based modeling with enhanced
                  sampling to generate conformational ensembles followed by
                  conformer selection with experimental data as an alternative
                  to conventional restraint satisfaction protocols for protein
                  NMR structure determination.},

                  protein-protein interactions. Chen et al. describe the design
                  of logic gates that can regulate protein association. The
                  gates were built from small, designed proteins that all have a
                  similar structure but where one module can be designed to
                  interact specifically with another module. Using monomers and
                  covalently connected monomers as inputs and encoding
                  specificity through designed hydrogen-bond networks allowed
                  the construction of two-input or three-input gates based on
                  competitive binding. The modular control elements were used to
                  regulate the association of elements of transcription
                  machinery and split enzymes in vitro and in yeast cells.
                  Science, this issue p. 78 Controlled interaction of designed
                  protein modules builds logic gates that can control
                  association of cellular proteins. The design of modular
                  protein logic for regulating protein function at the
                  posttranscriptional level is a challenge for synthetic
                  biology. Here, we describe the design of two-input AND, OR,
                  NAND, NOR, XNOR, and NOT gates built from de novo–designed
                  proteins. These gates regulate the association of arbitrary
                  protein units ranging from split enzymes to transcriptional
                  machinery in vitro, in yeast and in primary human T cells,
                  where they control the expression of the TIM3 gene related to
                  T cell exhaustion. Designed binding interaction cooperativity,
                  confirmed by native mass spectrometry, makes the gates largely
                  insensitive to stoichiometric imbalances in the inputs, and
                  the modularity of the approach enables ready extension to
                  three-input OR, AND, and disjunctive normal form gates. The
                  modularity and cooperativity of the control elements, coupled
                  with the ability to de novo design an essentially unlimited
                  number of protein components, should enable the design of
                  sophisticated posttranslational control logic over a wide

                  engineering of novel protein functionalities. Despite recent
                  progress in computational design strategies, de novo design of
                  protein structures remains challenging, given the vast size of
                  the sequence-structure space. AlphaFold2 (AF2), a
                  state-of-the-art neural network architecture, achieved
                  remarkable accuracy in predicting protein structures from
                  amino acid sequences. This raises the question whether AF2 has
                  learned the principles of protein folding sufficiently for de
                  novo design. Here, we sought to answer this question by
                  inverting the AF2 network, using the prediction weight set and
                  a loss function to bias the generated sequences to adopt a
                  target fold. Initial design trials resulted in de novo designs
                  with an overrepresentation of hydrophobic residues on the
                  protein surface compared to their natural protein family,
                  requiring additional surface optimization. In silico
                  validation of the designs showed protein structures with the
                  correct fold, a hydrophilic surface and a densely packed
                  hydrophobic core. In vitro validation showed that 7 out of 39
                  designs were folded and stable in solution with high melting
                  temperatures. In summary, our design workflow solely based on
                  AF2 does not seem to fully capture basic principles of de novo
                  protein design, as observed in the protein surface's
                  hydrophobic vs. hydrophilic patterning. However, with minimal
                  post-design intervention, these pipelines generated viable
                  sequences as assessed experimental characterization. Thus,
                  such pipelines show the potential to contribute to solving
                  outstanding challenges in de novo protein design.},

                  polar side chains, which, somewhat surprisingly, are often

                  of synthetic signaling pathways and the induction of
                  pluripotent stem cells. However, conventional approaches are
                  often inefficient, nonstoichiometric and may limit the maximum
                  number of genes that can be simultaneously expressed. We here
                  describe a versatile approach for multiple gene delivery using
                  a single expression vector by mimicking the protein expression
                  strategy of RNA viruses. This was accomplished by first
                  expressing the genes together with TEV protease as a single
                  fusion protein, then proteolytically self-cleaving the fusion
                  protein into functional components. To demonstrate this method
                  in E. coli cells, we analyzed the translation products using
                  SDS-PAGE and showed that the fusion protein was efficiently
                  cleaved into its components, which can then be purified
                  individually or as a binding complex. To demonstrate this
                  method in mammalian cells, we designed a differential
                  localization scheme and used live cell imaging to observe the
                  distinctive subcellular targeting of the processed products.
                  We also showed that the stoichiometry of the processed
                  products was consistent and corresponded with the frequency of
                  appearance of their genes on the expression vector. In
                  summary, the efficient expression and separation of up to
                  three genes was achieved in both E. coli and mammalian cells

                  structural biology, serving as highly reliable and effective
                  methods for predicting protein structures. This article
                  explores their impact and limitations, focusing on their
                  integration into experimental pipelines and their application
                  in diverse protein classes, including membrane proteins,
                  intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), and oligomers. In
                  experimental pipelines, AF2 models help X-ray crystallography
                  in resolving the phase problem, while complementarity with
                  mass spectrometry and NMR data enhances structure
                  determination and protein flexibility prediction. Predicting
                  the structure of membrane proteins remains challenging for
                  both AF2 and RF due to difficulties in capturing
                  conformational ensembles and interactions with the membrane.
                  Improvements in incorporating membrane-specific features and
                  predicting the structural effect of mutations are crucial. For
                  intrinsically disordered proteins, AF2's confidence score
                  (pLDDT) serves as a competitive disorder predictor, but
                  integrative approaches including molecular dynamics (MD)
                  simulations or hydrophobic cluster analyses are advocated for
                  accurate dynamics representation. AF2 and RF show promising
                  results for oligomeric models, outperforming traditional
                  docking methods, with AlphaFold-Multimer showing improved
                  performance. However, some caveats remain in particular for
                  membrane proteins. Real-life examples demonstrate AF2's
                  predictive capabilities in unknown protein structures, but
                  models should be evaluated for their agreement with
                  experimental data. Furthermore, AF2 models can be used
                  complementarily with MD simulations. In this Perspective, we
                  propose a "wish list" for improving deep-learning-based
                  protein folding prediction models, including using
                  experimental data as constraints and modifying models with
                  binding partners or post-translational modifications.
                  Additionally, a meta-tool for ranking and suggesting composite

                  Despite significant progress in protein structure prediction,
                  such as AlphaFold2, challenges remain on those hard targets
                  that Alphafold2 does not often perform well due to the complex
                  folding of protein and a large number of possible
                  conformations. Here we present a modified version of the
                  AlphaFold2, called Distance-AF, which aims to improve the
                  performance of AlphaFold2 by including distance constraints as
                  input information. Distance-AF uses AlphaFold2's predicted

                  constraints between amino acids to adjust folding of the
                  protein structure until it meets the constraints. Distance-AF
                  can correct the domain orientation on challenging targets,
                  leading to more accurate structures with a lower root mean

  abstract     = {For the proper organization of the six-layered mammalian
                  neocortex it is required that neurons migrate radially from
                  their place of birth towards their designated destination. The
                  molecular machinery underlying this neuronal migration is
                  still poorly understood. The dynein-adaptor protein BICD2 is
                  associated with a spectrum of human neurological diseases,
                  including malformations of cortical development. Previous
                  studies have shown that knockdown of BICD2 interferes with
                  interkinetic nuclear migration in radial glial progenitor
                  cells, and that Bicd2-deficient mice display an altered
                  laminar organization of the cerebellum and the neocortex.
                  However, the precise in vivo role of BICD2 in neocortical
                  development remains unclear. By comparing cell-type specific
                  conditional Bicd2 knock-out mice, we found that radial
                  migration in the cortex predominantly depends on BICD2
                  function in post-mitotic neurons. Neuron-specific Bicd2 cKO
                  mice showed severely impaired radial migration of late-born
                  upper-layer neurons. BICD2 depletion in cortical neurons
                  interfered with proper Golgi organization, and neuronal
                  maturation and survival of cortical plate neurons.
                  Single-neuron labeling revealed a specific role of BICD2 in
                  bipolar locomotion. Rescue experiments with wildtype and
                  disease-related mutant BICD2 constructs revealed that a
                  point-mutation in the RAB6/RANBP2-binding-domain, associated
                  with cortical malformation in patients, fails to restore
                  proper cortical neuron migration. Together, these findings
                  demonstrate a novel, cell-intrinsic role of BICD2 in cortical
                  neuron migration in vivo and provide new insights into
                  BICD2-dependent dynein-mediated functions during cortical
                  development.},

                  decade makes us optimistic that this ambition is within reach.
                  The development of artificial enzymes containing metal
                  cofactors and noncanonical organocatalytic groups shows how
                  protein structure can be optimized to harness the reactivity

                  methods have been used to design protein catalysts for diverse
                  reactions on the basis of fundamental principles of transition
                  state stabilization. Although the activities of designed
                  catalysts have been quite low, extensive laboratory evolution
                  has been used to generate efficient enzymes. Structural
                  analysis of these systems has revealed the high degree of

                  different THs is challenging. Nanopores, single-molecule

                  However, MSAs of homologous proteins are not always available,
                  such as with orphan proteins or fast-evolving proteins like
                  antibodies, and a protein typically folds in a natural setting
                  from its primary amino acid sequence into its

                  information and MSAs should not be necessary to predict a

                  similar prediction accuracy to AlphaFold2 on recently released

                  proteins that do not belong to any functionally characterized
                  protein family and antibodies that tend to have noisy MSAs due
                  to fast evolution. Our study fills a much-encountered gap in
                  structure prediction and brings us a step closer to

                  proteins in Escherichia coli. N-terminal fusions to the first
                  47 amino acids of the LpdA (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase A)
                  protein of Neisseria meningitidis have been shown to increase

                  the alpha-peptide sequence of beta-galactosidase were
                  connected via a ribosome-binding site, and two MCSs (multiple
                  cloning sites) were located surrounding the latter, allowing
                  efficient cloning by colour selection of recombinants. The
                  vector was also improved with the addition of a C-terminal
                  polyhistidine tag, and an EKS (enterokinase recognition
                  sequence) immediately after the LpdA fusion sequence. The new
                  plasmid was employed in the expression and purification of six
                  different bacterial polypeptides. One of these recombinant

                  enterokinase protease, while the polyhistidine tail
                  successfully allowed the purification of the unfused protein

                  sequence and structure pairs by iterative denoising, guided by
                  desired sequence and structural protein attributes. We
                  designed thermostable proteins with varying amino acid
                  compositions and internal sequence repeats and cage bioactive
                  peptides, such as melittin. By averaging sequence logits
                  between diffusion trajectories with distinct structural
                  constraints, we designed multistate parent-child protein
                  triples in which the same sequence folds to different
                  supersecondary structures when intact in the parent versus
                  split into two child domains. PG design trajectories can be
                  guided by experimental sequence-activity data, providing a
                  general approach for integrated computational and experimental
                  optimization of protein function.},

  abstract     = {INTRODUCTION The subcellular compartmentalization of
                  eukaryotic cells requires selective transport of folded
                  proteins and protein-nucleic acid complexes. Embedded in
                  nuclear envelope pores, which are generated by the
                  circumscribed fusion of the inner and outer nuclear membranes,
                  nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are the sole bidirectional
                  gateways for nucleocytoplasmic transport. The ~110-MDa human
                  NPC is an ~1000-protein assembly that comprises multiple
                  copies of ~34 different proteins, collectively termed
                  nucleoporins. The symmetric core of the NPC is composed of an
                  inner ring encircling the central transport channel and outer
                  rings formed by Y‑shaped coat nucleoporin complexes (CNCs)
                  anchored atop both sides of the nuclear envelope. The outer
                  rings are decorated with compartment‑specific asymmetric
                  nuclear basket and cytoplasmic filament nucleoporins, which
                  establish transport directionality and provide docking sites
                  for transport factors and the small guanosine triphosphatase
                  Ran. The cytoplasmic filament nucleoporins also play an
                  essential role in the irreversible remodeling of messenger
                  ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) as they exit the central
                  transport channel. Unsurprisingly, the NPC's cytoplasmic face
                  represents a hotspot for disease‑associated mutations and is
                  commonly targeted by viral virulence factors. RATIONALE
                  Previous studies established a near-atomic composite structure
                  of the human NPC's symmetric core by combining (i) biochemical
                  reconstitution to elucidate the interaction network between
                  symmetric nucleoporins, (ii) crystal and single-particle
                  cryo-electron microscopy structure determination of
                  nucleoporins and nucleoporin complexes to reveal their
                  three-dimensional shape and the molecular details of their
                  interactions, (iii) quantitative docking in cryo-electron
                  tomography (cryo-ET) maps of the intact human NPC to uncover
                  nucleoporin stoichiometry and positioning, and (iv) cell‑based
                  assays to validate the physiological relevance of the
                  biochemical and structural findings. In this work, we extended
                  our approach to the cytoplasmic filament nucleoporins to
                  reveal the near-atomic architecture of the cytoplasmic face of
                  the human NPC. RESULTS Using biochemical reconstitution, we
                  elucidated the protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction
                  networks of the human and Chaetomium thermophilum cytoplasmic
                  filament nucleoporins, establishing an evolutionarily
                  conserved heterohexameric cytoplasmic filament nucleoporin
                  complex (CFNC) held together by a central heterotrimeric
                  coiled‑coil hub that tethers two separate mRNP‑remodeling
                  complexes. Further biochemical analysis and determination of a
                  series of crystal structures revealed that the
                  metazoan‑specific cytoplasmic filament nucleoporin NUP358 is
                  composed of 16 distinct domains, including an N‑terminal
                  S‑shaped α‑helical solenoid followed by a coiled‑coil
                  oligomerization element, numerous Ran‑interacting domains, an
                  E3 ligase domain, and a C‑terminal prolyl‑isomerase domain.
                  Physiologically validated quantitative docking into cryo-ET
                  maps of the intact human NPC revealed that pentameric NUP358
                  bundles, conjoined by the oligomerization element, are
                  anchored through their N‑terminal domains to the central stalk
                  regions of the CNC, projecting flexibly attached domains as
                  far as ~600 Å into the cytoplasm. Using cell‑based assays, we
                  demonstrated that NUP358 is dispensable for the architectural
                  integrity of the assembled interphase NPC and RNA export but
                  is required for efficient translation. After NUP358
                  assignment, the remaining 4-shaped cryo‑ET density matched the
                  dimensions of the CFNC coiled‑coil hub, in close proximity to
                  an outer-ring NUP93. Whereas the N-terminal NUP93 assembly
                  sensor motif anchors the properly assembled related
                  coiled‑coil channel nucleoporin heterotrimer to the inner
                  ring, biochemical reconstitution confirmed that the NUP93
                  assembly sensor is reused in anchoring the CFNC to the
                  cytoplasmic face of the human NPC. By contrast, two C.
                  thermophilum CFNCs are anchored by a divergent mechanism that
                  involves assembly sensors located in unstructured portions of
                  two CNC nucleoporins. Whereas unassigned cryo‑ET density
                  occupies the NUP358 and CFNC binding sites on the nuclear
                  face, docking of the nuclear basket component ELYS established
                  that the equivalent position on the cytoplasmic face is
                  unoccupied, suggesting that mechanisms other than steric
                  competition promote asymmetric distribution of nucleoporins.
                  CONCLUSION We have substantially advanced the biochemical and
                  structural characterization of the asymmetric nucleoporins'
                  architecture and attachment at the cytoplasmic and nuclear
                  faces of the NPC. Our near‑atomic composite structure of the
                  human NPC's cytoplasmic face provides a biochemical and
                  structural framework for elucidating the molecular basis of
                  mRNP remodeling, viral virulence factor interference with NPC
                  function, and the underlying mechanisms of nucleoporin
                  diseases at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC. [Figure: see

                  proteins. Using the database, we performed systematic analysis
                  that reveals a rapid increase in the number and complexity of
                  designs over time and uncovers biases in their amino-acid

                  structural studies is not trivial, and failure to handle them
                  properly is often a source of irreproducibility caused by
                  issues such as pH changes, incorporation of unexpected metals,
                  or oxidization/reduction of the metal. This protocol outlines
                  the guidelines and best practices for characterizing
                  metal-binding sites in protein structures and alerts
                  experimenters to potential pitfalls during the preparation and
                  handling of metal-containing protein samples for X-ray
                  crystallography studies. The protocol features strategies for
                  controlling the sample pH and the metal oxidation state,
                  recording X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectra, and collecting

                  accurately characterize the coordinating ligands in the metal

                  learning-based model that can accurately infer protein
                  structure from sequence-may discern important features of
                  folded protein energy landscapes, defined by the diversity and
                  frequency of different conformations in the folded state.
                  Here, we test the limits of its predictive power on
                  fold-switching proteins, which assume two structures with
                  regions of distinct secondary and/or tertiary structure. Using
                  several implementations of AF2, including two published
                  enhanced sampling approaches, we generated >280,000 models of
                  93 fold-switching proteins whose experimentally determined
                  conformations were likely in AF2's training set. Combining all
                  models, AF2 predicted fold switching with a modest success
                  rate of ~25\%, indicating that it does not readily sample both
                  experimentally characterized conformations of most fold
                  switchers. Further, AF2's confidence metrics selected against
                  models consistent with experimentally determined
                  fold-switching conformations in favor of inconsistent models.
                  Accordingly, these confidence metrics-though suggested to
                  evaluate protein energetics reliably-did not discriminate
                  between low and high energy states of fold-switching proteins.
                  We then evaluated AF2's performance on seven fold-switching
                  proteins outside of its training set, generating >159,000
                  models in total. Fold switching was accurately predicted in
                  one of seven targets with moderate confidence. Further, AF2
                  demonstrated no ability to predict alternative conformations
                  of two newly discovered targets without homologs in the set of
                  93 fold switchers. These results indicate that AF2 has more to
                  learn about the underlying energetics of protein ensembles and
                  highlight the need for further developments of methods that
                  readily predict multiple protein conformations.},

                  designed to enhance the transparency of protein foundation
                  models. Our approach consists of three key components: (i) A

                  main challenges in the protein domain, based on the

                  across four key dimensions: quality, novelty, diversity, and
                  robustness; and (iii) In-depth analyses from various user

                  cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) is limited by the alignment of noisy
                  images of individual particles. Because smaller particles have
                  weaker signals, alignment errors impose size limitations on
                  its applicability. Here, we explore how image alignment is
                  improved by the application of deep-learning to exploit prior
                  knowledge about biological macromolecular structures that
                  would otherwise be difficult to express mathematically. We
                  train a denoising convolutional neural network on pairs of
                  half-set reconstructions from the electron microscopy data
                  bank (EMDB) and use this denoiser as an alternative to a
                  commonly used smoothness prior. We demonstrate that this
                  approach, which we call Blush regularisation, yields better
                  reconstructions than existing algorithms, in particular for
                  data with low signal-to-noise ratios. The reconstruction of a
                  protein-nucleic acid complex with a molecular weight of 40
                  kDa, which was previously intractable, illustrates that
                  regularisation through denoising will expand the applicability
                  of cryo-EM structure determination for a wide range of
                  biological macromolecules.}

                  changes only slightly when a small amount of a strong acid or
                  bases is added to it. This is widely accepted and applied both
                  in chemical and in biological (i.e. enzyme catalysis) systems.
                  Here we show some examples – spanning from pH measurements,
                  enzyme activities, electrophoretic mobilities, antibody
                  aggregation, protein thermal stability – that demonstrate
                  additional roles of buffers. They not only set pH, but also
                  address specific ion effects, in terms of Hofmeister series,
                  when strong electrolytes are also added. From the experimental
                  data referred to some charged biological moieties it emerges
                  that different buffers, at the same nominal pH, can
                  specifically adsorb at the charged surface. Buffer specific
                  adsorption modifies several molecular and macroscopic
                  properties amongst which electrophoretic mobilities, and hence
                  effective surface charges, are particularly significant. More
                  importantly, buffers' weak electrolytes, even at low
                  concentration, are found to compete for the adsorption at the

                  recruits the opposing microtubule motors kinesin-1 and dynein
                  [via the dynein adaptor Bicaudal D2 (BicD2)] to the nuclear
                  envelope. This pathway is important for positioning of the
                  nucleus during the early steps of mitotic spindle assembly and
                  also essential for an important process in brain development.
                  It is unknown whether dynein and kinesin-1 interact with
                  Nup358 simultaneously or whether they compete. Here, we have
                  reconstituted and characterized a minimal complex of kinesin-1
                  light chain 2 (KLC2) and Nup358. The proteins interact through
                  a W-acidic motif in Nup358, which is highly conserved among
                  vertebrates but absent in insects. While Nup358 and KLC2 form
                  predominantly monomers, their interaction results in the
                  formation of 2:2 complexes, and the W-acidic motif is required
                  for the oligomerization. In active motor complexes, BicD2 and
                  KLC2 each form dimers. Notably, we show that the dynein
                  adaptor BicD2 and KLC2 interact simultaneously with Nup358,
                  resulting in the formation of 2:2:2 complexes. Mutation of the
                  W-acidic motif results in the formation of 1:1:1 complexes. On
                  the basis of our data, we propose that Nup358 recruits
                  simultaneously one kinesin-1 motor and one dynein motor via
                  BicD2 to the nucleus. We hypothesize that the binding sites
                  are close enough to promote direct interactions between these
                  motor recognition domains, which may be important for the
                  regulation of the motility of these opposing motors. Our data
                  provide important insights into a nuclear positioning pathway

                  Escherichia coli. Investigation of factors that affect
                  stability, growth, and induction of T7 expression strains in
                  shaking vessels led to the recognition that sporadic,
                  unintended induction of expression in complex media,
                  previously reported by others, is almost certainly caused by
                  small amounts of lactose. Glucose prevents induction by
                  lactose by well-studied mechanisms. Amino acids also inhibit
                  induction by lactose during log-phase growth, and high rates
                  of aeration inhibit induction at low lactose concentrations.
                  These observations, and metabolic balancing of pH, allowed
                  development of reliable non-inducing and auto-inducing media
                  in which batch cultures grow to high densities. Expression
                  strains grown to saturation in non-inducing media retain

                  making it easy to prepare many freezer stocks in parallel and
                  use working stocks for an extended period. Auto-induction
                  allows efficient screening of many clones in parallel for
                  expression and solubility, as cultures have only to be
                  inoculated and grown to saturation, and yields of target
                  protein are typically several-fold higher than obtained by
                  conventional IPTG induction. Auto-inducing media have been
                  developed for labeling proteins with selenomethionine, 15N or
                  13C, and for production of target proteins by arabinose
                  induction of T7 RNA polymerase from the pBAD promoter in
                  BL21-AI. Selenomethionine labeling was equally efficient in
                  the commonly used methionine auxotroph B834(DE3) (found to be

                  use deep learning–generated pseudocycles with repeating
                  structural units surrounding central binding pockets with
                  widely varying shapes that depend on the geometry and number
                  of the repeat units. We dock small molecules of interest into
                  the most shape complementary of these pseudocycles, design the
                  interaction surfaces for high binding affinity, and
                  experimentally screen to identify designs with the highest
                  affinity. We obtain binders to four diverse molecules,
                  including the polar and flexible methotrexate and thyroxine.
                  Taking advantage of the modular repeat structure and central

                  summary A major current challenge in protein design is the de
                  novo creation of selective and high-affinity
                  small-molecule–binding proteins. One promising concept is a
                  small domain that could be incorporated into other
                  applications with ease. An et al. designed small, pseudocyclic
                  peptides with a central cavity that can be expanded or reduced
                  by changing the number of repeating units to match the size of
                  a target ligand. High-throughput screening and computational
                  resampling enabled the creation of second-generation binders
                  with substantially higher affinities for four example target
                  molecules. The authors demonstrate two applications of such
                  binders that rely on incorporating them as a domain into a
                  larger, de novo–designed protein: a nanopore fusion for
                  small-molecule sensing and a split protein for chemically
                  induced dimerization. —Michael A. Funk}

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Despite the immense importance of transmembrane
                  proteins (TMP) for molecular biology and medicine,
                  experimental 3D structures for TMPs remain about 4-5 times
                  underrepresented compared to non-TMPs. Today's top methods
                  such as AlphaFold2 accurately predict 3D structures for many
                  TMPs, but annotating transmembrane regions remains a limiting
                  step for proteome-wide predictions. RESULTS: Here, we present
                  TMbed, a novel method inputting embeddings from protein
                  Language Models (pLMs, here ProtT5), to predict for each
                  residue one of four classes: transmembrane helix (TMH),
                  transmembrane strand (TMB), signal peptide, or other. TMbed
                  completes predictions for entire proteomes within hours on a
                  single consumer-grade desktop machine at performance levels
                  similar or better than methods, which are using evolutionary
                  information from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of
                  protein families. On the per-protein level, TMbed correctly
                  identified 94 ± 8\% of the beta barrel TMPs (53 of 57) and 98
                  ± 1\% of the alpha helical TMPs (557 of 571) in a
                  non-redundant data set, at false positive rates well below 1\%
                  (erred on 30 of 5654 non-membrane proteins). On the
                  per-segment level, TMbed correctly placed, on average, 9 of 10
                  transmembrane segments within five residues of the
                  experimental observation. Our method can handle sequences of
                  up to 4200 residues on standard graphics cards used in desktop
                  PCs (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060). CONCLUSIONS: Based on
                  embeddings from pLMs and two novel filters (Gaussian and
                  Viterbi), TMbed predicts alpha helical and beta barrel TMPs at
                  least as accurately as any other method but at lower false
                  positive rates. Given the few false positives and its
                  outstanding speed, TMbed might be ideal to sieve through
                  millions of 3D structures soon to be predicted, e.g., by
                  AlphaFold2.},

                  most cells infected by internal promoter or regulated splicing
                  vectors expressed either LacZ or CAT but not both. In
                  addition, viral titers were highest with IRES vectors.
                  Presumably, use of the IRES avoids transcriptional controls
                  and RNA processing steps that differentially affect expression
                  of multiple genes from internal promoter and regulated
                  splicing vectors. Finally, we injected a LacZ-IRES-v-Src virus
                  into chicken embryos and then identified the progeny of
                  infected cells with a histochemical stain for LacZ.
                  LacZ-positive cells in both skin and mesenchyme displayed
                  morphological abnormalities attributable to expression of
                  v-src. Thus, IRES vectors can be used to coexpress a reporter
                  gene and a bioactive gene in vivo.}

                  generation of proteins with sequence specific attributes and
                  functional properties. To overcome this limitation, we develop
                  ProteinGenerator, a sequence space diffusion model based on
                  RoseTTAfold that simultaneously generates protein sequences
                  and structures. Beginning from random amino acid sequences,
                  our model generates sequence and structure pairs by iterative
                  denoising, guided by any desired sequence and structural
                  protein attributes. To explore the versatility of this
                  approach, we designed proteins enriched for specific amino
                  acids, with internal sequence repeats, with masked bioactive
                  peptides, with state dependent structures, and with key
                  sequence features of specific protein families.
                  ProteinGenerator readily generates sequence-structure pairs
                  satisfying the input conditioning (sequence and/or structural)
                  criteria, and experimental validation showed that the designs
                  were monomeric by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), had the
                  desired secondary structure content by circular dichroism
                  (CD), and were thermostable up to 95°C. By enabling the
                  simultaneous optimization of both sequence and structure,
                  ProteinGenerator allows for the design of functional proteins
                  with specific sequence and structural attributes, and paves
                  the way for protein function optimization by active learning

                  increasingly impactful in biophysics because they offer
                  atomistic resolution of structural fluctuations in relation to
                  their functional outputs. Yet quantitative characterization of
                  multiscale processes is a formidable challenge due to the
                  distribution of motions that evade analysis of discrete
                  simulation data. Here we investigate the efficient calculation
                  of CH bond relaxation rates from membrane simulations. Widely
                  used computational approaches offer numerical simplicity but
                  fall short of capturing crucial aspects of the orientation
                  dependence of the dynamics. To circumvent this problem, we
                  introduced a robust framework based on liquid crystal theory
                  which considers explicitly the CH bond motions with respect to
                  the director axis (bilayer normal). Analysis of the
                  orientation dependence of the dynamics shows excellent
                  agreement with experiment, illustrating how the ordering
                  potential affects the calculated relaxation rates.
                  Furthermore, a fit-based resampling of the autocorrelation
                  function of the bond fluctuations validates the new approach
                  for low-temporal resolution data. The recovered relaxation
                  rates indicate that at short timescales, both with and without
                  cholesterol, the local motions of CH bonds describe the
                  bilayer microviscosity and resemble liquid hydrocarbons. Our
                  results establish the critical role of the orientational
                  anisotropy in analysis of membrane simulations, explain
                  fundamental aspects of lipid dynamics, and provide guidelines

                  protein tags on the yeast DEAD-box ATPase Dhh1, a central
                  regulator of processing bodies (P-bodies), which are

                  protein. Many strategies have been adopted, among which 2A
                  "self-cleaving" peptides have garnered increased interest for
                  their polycistronic nature, small size and high "cleavage"
                  efficiency. However, broad application of 2 A peptides is
                  limited by the lack of systematic comparison of different 2As
                  alone or in combination. Here we characterized the effect of
                  varying gene position and 2As on the expression of proteins
                  encoded in bi-, tri-, or quad-cistronic constructs. Using
                  direct cardiac reprogramming as an example, we further
                  determined the effect of varied 2As on the efficiency of
                  fluorescent cell labeling and cell fate conversion. We found
                  that the expression of fluorophores decreased as it was moved
                  towards the end of the construct while reprogramming was most
                  efficient with the fluorophore at the second position.
                  Moreover, quad-cistronic TPE2A constructs resulted in more
                  efficient reprogramming than 3P2A or PTE2A constructs. We
                  expect that the bi-, tri-, and quad-cistronic vectors

                  structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their
                  function. Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the
                  structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been
                  determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the
                  billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is
                  bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort
                  required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate
                  computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to
                  enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the
                  three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based
                  solely on its amino acid sequence-the structure prediction
                  component of the 'protein folding problem'8-has been an
                  important open research problem for more than 50 years9.
                  Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short
                  of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is
                  available. Here we provide the first computational method that
                  can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy
                  even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We
                  validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural
                  network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th
                  Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction
                  (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with
                  experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly
                  outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version
                  of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that
                  incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein
                  structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the

                  simulation and design is an important step in increasing the
                  accuracy of computational protein modeling. Recent analysis of
                  high-resolution crystal structures has suggested a new model,
                  termed backrub, to describe localized, hinge-like alternative
                  backbone and side-chain conformations observed in the crystal
                  lattice. The model involves internal backbone rotations about
                  axes between C-alpha atoms. Based on this observation, we have
                  implemented a backrub-inspired sampling method in the Rosetta
                  structure prediction and design program. We evaluate this
                  model of backbone flexibility using three different tests.
                  First, we show that Rosetta backrub simulations recapitulate
                  the correlation between backbone and side-chain conformations
                  in the high-resolution crystal structures upon which the model
                  was based. As a second test of backrub sampling, we show that
                  backbone flexibility improves the accuracy of predicting
                  point-mutant side-chain conformations over fixed backbone
                  rotameric sampling alone. Finally, we show that backrub
                  sampling of triosephosphate isomerase loop 6 can capture the
                  millisecond/microsecond oscillation between the open and
                  closed states observed in solution. Our results suggest that
                  backrub sampling captures a sizable fraction of localized
                  conformational changes that occur in natural proteins.
                  Application of this simple model of backbone motions may
                  significantly improve both protein design and atomistic
                  simulations of localized protein flexibility.},

                  26 genes with a varying degree of hereditary cancer risk

                  missense variations reported in any of these 26 genes. More
                  than a thousand missense variants were collected from ClinVar
                  and the targeted screen of a breast cancer cohort of 355
                  patients which contributed to this set with 160 novel missense
                  variations. We analyzed the impact of the missense variations

                  both sequence- (SAAF2EC and MUpro) and structure-based
                  (Maestro, mCSM, CUPSAT) predictors. For the structure-based

                  which comprise the first structural analysis of this

                  benchmarks that computed the power of stability predictors in
                  discriminating the pathogenic variants. Overall, we reported a
                  low-to-medium-level performance for the stability predictors
                  in discriminating pathogenic variants, except MUpro which had
                  an AUROC of 0.534 (95\% CI [0.499-0.570]). The AUROC values
                  ranged between 0.614-0.719 for the total set and 0.596-0.682
                  for the set with high AF2 confidence regions. Furthermore, our
                  findings revealed that the confidence score for a given
                  variant in the AF2 structure could alone predict pathogenicity
                  more robustly than any of the tested stability predictors with
                  an AUROC of 0.852. Altogether, this study represents the first
                  structural analysis of the 26 hereditary cancer genes
                  underscoring 1) the thermodynamic stability predicted from AF2

                  of generative models called diffusion models has demonstrated
                  the ability to generate biologically plausible proteins that
                  are dissimilar to any actual proteins seen in nature, enabling
                  unprecedented capability and control inde novoprotein design.
                  However, current state-of-the-art diffusion models generate
                  protein structures, which limits the scope of their training
                  data and restricts generations to a small and biased subset of
                  protein design space. Here, we introduce a general-purpose
                  diffusion framework, EvoDiff, that combines evolutionary-scale
                  data with the distinct conditioning capabilities of diffusion
                  models for controllable protein generation in sequence space.
                  EvoDiff generates high-fidelity, diverse, and
                  structurally-plausible proteins that cover natural sequence
                  and functional space. We show experimentally that EvoDiff
                  generations express, fold, and exhibit expected secondary
                  structure elements. Critically, EvoDiff can generate proteins
                  inaccessible to structure-based models, such as those with
                  disordered regions, while maintaining the ability to design
                  scaffolds for functional structural motifs. We validate the
                  universality of our sequence-based formulation by
                  experimentally characterizing intrinsically-disordered
                  mitochondrial targeting signals, metal-binding proteins, and
                  protein binders designed using EvoDiff. We envision that

                  membrane-bound proteins contain elements that promote an
                  alternative mRNA nuclear export (ALREX) pathway. Here we
                  report that ALREX-promoting elements also potentiate
                  translation in the presence of upstream nuclear factors. These
                  RNA elements interact directly with, and likely co-evolved
                  with, the zinc finger repeats of RanBP2/Nup358, which is
                  present on the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore. Finally
                  we show that RanBP2/Nup358 is not only required for the
                  stimulation of translation by ALREX-promoting elements, but is
                  also required for the efficient global synthesis of proteins
                  targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and likely the
                  mitochondria. Thus upon the completion of export, mRNAs
                  containing ALREX-elements likely interact with RanBP2/Nup358,
                  and this step is required for the efficient translation of
                  these mRNAs in the cytoplasm. ALREX-elements thus act as
                  nucleotide platforms to coordinate various steps of
                  post-transcriptional regulation for the majority of mRNAs that
                  encode secreted proteins.},

                  allows up to 25 cDNAs to be assembled into a single

                  At the end of a three-enzyme cascade, E3 ubiquitin ligases
                  (E3s) recruit substrates and promote or directly catalyze

                  the CHARMM 19 polar hydrogen energy function, it provides an
                  effective energy function (EEF1) for proteins in solution. The
                  solvation model assumes that the solvation free energy of a
                  protein molecule is a sum of group contributions, which are
                  determined from values for small model compounds. For charged
                  groups, the self‐energy contribution is accounted for
                  primarily by the exclusion model. Ionic side‐chains are
                  neutralized, and a distance‐dependent dielectric constant is
                  used to approximate the charge–charge interactions in
                  solution. The resulting EEF1 is subjected to a number of
                  tests. Molecular dynamics simulations at room temperature of

                  explicit water simulations. The calculated enthalpy of
                  unfolding of a polyalanine helix is found to be in good
                  agreement with experimental data. Results reported elsewhere
                  show that EEF1 clearly distinguishes correctly from
                  incorrectly folded proteins, both in static energy evaluations
                  and in molecular dynamics simulations and that unfolding
                  pathways obtained by high‐temperature molecular dynamics
                  simulations agree with those obtained by explicit water
                  simulations. Thus, this energy function appears to provide a

                  manifold of ligand poses. To do so, we map this manifold to

                  rotational, and torsional) involved in docking and develop an
                  efficient diffusion process on this space. Empirically,
                  DiffDock obtains a 38\% top-1 success rate (RMSD<2A) on
                  PDBBind, significantly outperforming the previous
                  state-of-the-art of traditional docking (23\%) and deep
                  learning (20\%) methods. Moreover, while previous methods are
                  not able to dock on computationally folded structures (maximum
                  accuracy 10.4\%), DiffDock maintains significantly higher

                  differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) data for simultaneous
                  determination of nandrolone decanoate (ND) and testosterone
                  decanoate (TS). An indium tin oxide (ITO) was modified with
                  multiwalled carbon nanotubes-graphene-ionic liquid
                  (MWCNT-Gr-IL) and then, the fullerene C60 was casted onto the
                  surface of MWCNT-Gr-IL/ITO and electrochemically reduced.
                  Finally, DTMIPs were electrosynthesized by
                  electropolymerization of 4-aminobenzoic acid (ABA) as monomer

                  PS3 (TF(1)) is one of the best-studied of all molecular
                  machines. F(1)-ATPase is the part of the enzyme F(1)F(O)-ATP
                  synthase that is responsible for generating most of the ATP in
                  living cells. Single-molecule experiments have provided a
                  detailed understanding of how ATP hydrolysis and synthesis are

                  processes occur faster in EF(1) than in TF(1), and we present
                  a methodology to compensate for artefacts that occur when the
                  enzymatic rates are comparable to the experimental temporal
                  resolution. Furthermore, we show that the molecule-to-molecule
                  variation observed at high ATP concentration in our

                  the Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the human

                  the conformation and dynamics of the RBD prior to its
                  interaction with ACE2. In this work, we utilize molecular
                  dynamics simulations to probe the flexibility and
                  conformational ensemble of the unbound state of the
                  receptor-binding domain from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We have

                  the three-dimensional structure of the target remains a
                  challenge1-5. Here we describe a general solution to this
                  problem that starts with a broad exploration of the vast space
                  of possible binding modes to a selected region of a protein
                  surface, and then intensifies the search in the vicinity of
                  the most promising binding modes. We demonstrate the broad
                  applicability of this approach through the de novo design of
                  binding proteins to 12 diverse protein targets with different
                  shapes and surface properties. Biophysical characterization
                  shows that the binders, which are all smaller than 65 amino
                  acids, are hyperstable and, following experimental
                  optimization, bind their targets with nanomolar to picomolar
                  affinities. We succeeded in solving crystal structures of five
                  of the binder-target complexes, and all five closely match the
                  corresponding computational design models. Experimental data
                  on nearly half a million computational designs and hundreds of
                  thousands of point mutants provide detailed feedback on the
                  strengths and limitations of the method and of our current
                  understanding of protein-protein interactions, and should
                  guide improvements of both. Our approach enables the targeted

                  the macromolecules involved. For example, deciphering the
                  double-helical nature of DNA revealed essential aspects of how
                  genetic information is stored, copied and repaired. Yet, being
                  reductionist in nature, structural biology requires the
                  purification of large amounts of macromolecules, often trimmed
                  off larger functional units. The advent of cryogenic electron
                  microscopy (cryo-EM) greatly facilitated the study of large,
                  functional complexes and generally of samples that are hard to
                  express, purify and/or crystallize. Nevertheless, cryo-EM
                  still requires purification and thus visualization outside of
                  the natural context in which macromolecules operate and
                  coexist. Conversely, cell biologists have been imaging cells
                  using a number of fast-evolving techniques that keep expanding
                  their spatial and temporal reach, but always far from the
                  resolution at which chemistry can be understood. Thus,
                  structural and cell biology provide complementary, yet
                  unconnected visions of the inner workings of cells. Here we
                  discuss how the interplay between cryo-EM and cryo-electron
                  tomography, as a connecting bridge to visualize macromolecules
                  in situ, holds great promise to create comprehensive
                  structural depictions of macromolecules as they interact in

  abstract     = {The structure, function, and evolution of proteins depend on
                  physical and genetic interactions among amino acids. Recent
                  studies have used new strategies to explore the prevalence,
                  biochemical mechanisms, and evolutionary implications of these
                  interactions-called epistasis-within proteins. Here we
                  describe an emerging picture of pervasive epistasis in which
                  the physical and biological effects of mutations change over
                  the course of evolution in a lineage-specific fashion.
                  Epistasis can restrict the trajectories available to an
                  evolving protein or open new paths to sequences and functions
                  that would otherwise have been inaccessible. We describe two
                  broad classes of epistatic interactions, which arise from
                  different physical mechanisms and have different effects on
                  evolutionary processes. Specific epistasis-in which one
                  mutation influences the phenotypic effect of few other
                  mutations-is caused by direct and indirect physical
                  interactions between mutations, which nonadditively change the
                  protein's physical properties, such as conformation,
                  stability, or affinity for ligands. In contrast, nonspecific
                  epistasis describes mutations that modify the effect of many
                  others; these typically behave additively with respect to the
                  physical properties of a protein but exhibit epistasis because
                  of a nonlinear relationship between the physical properties
                  and their biological effects, such as function or fitness.
                  Both types of interaction are rampant, but specific epistasis
                  has stronger effects on the rate and outcomes of evolution,
                  because it imposes stricter constraints and modulates
                  evolutionary potential more dramatically; it therefore makes
                  evolution more contingent on low-probability historical events
                  and leaves stronger marks on the sequences, structures, and
                  functions of protein families.},

                  Despite their importance, the similarities in their
                  sterol-binding domains have made the identification of
                  selective modulators difficult. Herein we report a combination

                  identification of potent and selective inhibitors of sterol
                  transport proteins. The fusion of a primary sterol scaffold
                  with a range of different fragments found in natural products
                  followed by various ring distortions allowed the synthesis of

                  spirooxepinoindole as a privileged scaffold for sterol
                  transport proteins. With careful optimization of the scaffold,
                  the selectivity could be directed toward a single transporter,

                  Protein PTMs have also emerged as reliable biomarkers for
                  several diseases. However, only a handful of techniques are
                  available to accurately measure their levels, capture their
                  complexity at a single molecule level, and characterize their
                  multifaceted roles in health and disease. Nanopore sensing
                  provides high sensitivity for the detection of low-abundance
                  proteins, holding the potential to impact single-molecule
                  proteomics and PTM detection, in particular. Here, we
                  demonstrate the ability of a biological nanopore, the
                  pore-forming toxin aerolysin, to detect and distinguish
                  α-synuclein-derived peptides bearing single or multiple PTMs,

                  sensors, they have been engineered through various methods
                  resulting in the accurate and highly sensitive detection of
                  biomarkers and disease-related biomolecules. Among diverse
                  biological nanopores, the β-barrel-containing nanopores have
                  advantages in nanopore engineering because of their robust
                  structure, making them well-suited for modifications. In this
                  review, we highlight the engineering approaches for
                  β-barrel-containing nanopores used in single-molecule sensing
                  for applications in early diagnosis and prognosis. In the
                  highlighted studies, β-barrel nanopores can be modified by
                  genetic mutation to change the structure; alter charge
                  distributions; or add enzymes, aptamers, and protein probes to
                  enhance sensitivity and accuracy. Furthermore, this review
                  discusses challenges and future perspectives for advancing
                  nanopore-based diagnostic sensors.},

               leverages pre-trained parameters to extract features to train
               machine learning models or adjust the weights of PLMs for novel
               tasks via fine-tuning through back-propagation. TL methods have
               shown potential for enhancing protein predictions performance
               when paired with PLMs, however there is a notable lack of
               comparative analyses that benchmark TL methods applied to
               state-of-the-art PLMs, identify optimal strategies for
               transferring knowledge and determine the most suitable approach
               for specific tasks. Here, we report PLMFit, a benchmarking study
               that combines, three state-of-the-art PLMs (ESM2, ProGen2,
               ProteinBert), with three TL methods (feature extraction, low-rank
               adaptation, bottleneck adapters) for five protein engineering
               datasets. We conducted over 2900 experiments, altering PLM sizes
               and layers, TL hyperparameters and different training procedures.
               Our experiments reveal three key findings: (i) utilizing a
               fraction of PLM for transfer learning does not detrimentally
               impact performance, (ii) the choice between feature extraction
               and fine-tuning is primarily dictated by the amount and diversity
               of data and (iii) fine-tuning is most effective when
               generalization is necessary and only limited data is available.
               We provide PLMFit as an open-source software package, serving as
               a valuable resource for the scientific community to facilitate

                  to reveal the role of the shape complementarity in the
                  protein-protein interactions, i.e., when the two proteins with
                  shape complementarity approach each other, the conformation of
                  lipid chains between two proteins would be restricted
                  significantly. The lipid molecules tend to leave the gap
                  formed by two proteins to maximize the configuration entropy,
                  and therefore yield an effective entropy-induced
                  protein-protein attraction, which enhances the protein
                  aggregation. In short, this work provides an insight into
                  understanding the importance of the shape complementarity in

                  that play an important role in several neurodegenerative and
                  systemic diseases. Although structural information of the
                  amyloid state is now abundant, mechanistic details about the
                  misfolding process remain elusive. Inspired by the Φ-value
                  analysis of protein folding, we combined experiments and
                  molecular simulations to resolve amino-acid contacts and
                  determine the structure of the transition-state ensemble—the
                  rate-limiting step—for fibril elongation of PI3K-SH3 amyloid
                  fibrils. The ensemble was validated experimentally by Tanford
                  β analysis and computationally by free energy calculations.
                  Although protein folding proceeds on funnel-shaped landscapes,
                  here we find that the energy landscape for the misfolding
                  reaction consists of a large ‘golf course’ region, defined by
                  a single energy barrier and transition state, accessing a
                  sharply funnelled region. Thus, misfolding occurs by rare,
                  successful monomer–fibril end collisions interspersed by
                  numerous unsuccessful binding attempts. Taken together, these
                  insights provide a quantitative and highly resolved
                  description of a protein misfolding reaction. Amyloid fibrils
                  grow through the recruitment of soluble monomer to the fibril
                  end that propagates the fibril structure. Here the transition
                  state, the rate-limiting conformation, of such a reaction has
                  been characterized by Φ-value analysis. An energy landscape
                  model has been developed and fibril growth rates predicted

                  coil geometry has been widely useful for guiding design of new
                  protein structures and functions. However, design guided by
                  similar global parameterization of beta barrel structures has
                  been less successful, likely due to the deviations from ideal
                  barrel geometry required to maintain inter-strand hydrogen
                  bonding without introducing backbone strain. Instead, beta
                  barrels have been designed using 2D structural blueprints;
                  while this approach has successfully generated new fluorescent
                  proteins, transmembrane nanopores, and other structures, it
                  requires expert knowledge and provides only indirect control
                  over the global shape. Here we show that the simplicity and
                  control over shape and structure provided by parametric
                  representations can be generalized beyond coiled coils by
                  taking advantage of the rich sequence-structure relationships
                  implicit in RoseTTAFold based design methods. Starting from
                  parametrically generated barrel backbones, both RFjoint
                  inpainting and RFdiffusion readily incorporate backbone
                  irregularities necessary for proper folding with minimal
                  deviation from the idealized barrel geometries. We show that
                  for beta barrels across a broad range of beta sheet
                  parameterizations, these methods achieve high in silico and
                  experimental success rates, with atomic accuracy confirmed by
                  an X-ray crystal structure of a novel barrel topology, and de
                  novo designed 12, 14, and 16 stranded transmembrane nanopores
                  with conductances ranging from 200 to 500 pS. By combining the
                  simplicity and control of parametric generation with the high
                  success rates of deep learning based protein design methods,
                  our approach makes the design of proteins where global shape
                  confers function, such as beta barrel nanopores, more
                  precisely specifiable and accessible. Significance De novo
                  beta barrel proteins have previously been designed using
                  “blueprint” based methods which require expert knowledge of
                  the rules of folding and provide only indirect control of the
                  overall barrel shape by specifying structural features such as
                  glycine kinks and beta bulges. The barrel shape can be
                  directly modeled using global parametric methods, but to date
                  such methods have not succeeded in generating folded proteins,
                  likely due to the absence of such structural features. Here,
                  we describe methods that combine the simplicity and control of
                  parametric barrel specification with the high success rates of
                  deep learning based protein design methods to successfully
                  design new beta barrel folds of different and pre-specified
                  sizes, including both soluble designs and transmembrane
                  nanopores.}

                  experimental analysis of human missense variants across many
                  different proteins. Using DNA synthesis and cellular selection
                  experiments we quantify the effect of more than 500,000
                  variants on the abundance of more than 500 human protein
                  domains. This dataset reveals that 60\% of pathogenic missense
                  variants reduce protein stability. The contribution of
                  stability to protein fitness varies across proteins and

                  function, with its capability to perform differentiable

                  prove this phenomenon theoretically, and propose adaptive

                  that are driven in part by fission and fusion events. However,
                  there are other reorganizations of the network that do not
                  involve fission and fusion. One such exception is the elusive,
                  “beads-on-a-string” morphological transition of mitochondria.
                  During such transitions, the cylindrical tubes of the
                  mitochondrial membrane transiently undergo shape changes to a
                  string of “pearls” connected along thin tubes. These dynamics
                  have been anecdotally observed in many contexts and given
                  disparate explanations. Here we unify these observations by
                  proposing a common underlying mechanism based on the
                  biophysical properties of tubular fluid membranes for which it
                  is known that, under particular regimes of tension and
                  pressure, membranes reach an instability and undergo a shape
                  transition to a string of connected pearls. First, we use
                  high-speed light-sheet microscopy to show that transient,
                  short-lived pearling events occur spontaneously in the
                  mitochondrial network in every cell type we have examined,
                  including primary fibroblasts, T-cells, neurons, and budding
                  yeast. We present evidence that transient mitochondrial
                  pearling occurs during important biological events,
                  particularly during T cell activation and neuronal firing.
                  Using our high-temporal resolution data, we identify two
                  distinct categories of spontaneous pearling, i) internal
                  pressure-driven pearling regulated by ionic flux, and ii)
                  external tension-driven pearling regulated by molecular
                  motors. By applying live-cell STED microscopy we document the
                  structural reorganization of inner cristae membranes during
                  mitochondrial pearling. We then compare numerous methods for
                  inducing pearling, including the ability to induce these
                  dynamics with single mitochondrion precision. These methods
                  include ionophores, channel activators, osmotic shock,
                  detergents, laser stimulation, membrane intercalating
                  molecules, chemical fixation, and micro-needle force. These
                  disparate inducers establish three main physical causes of
                  pearling, i) ionic flux amplifying internal osmotic pressure,
                  ii) membrane packing lowering bending elasticity, and iii)
                  external mechanical force increasing membrane tension.
                  Pearling dynamics thereby reveal a fundamental biophysical
                  facet of mitochondrial biology. We suggest that pearling
                  should take its place beside fission and fusion as a key
                  process of mitochondrial dynamics, with implications for
                  physiology, disease, and aging.},

                  of a clade, is important for key tasks in biology including
                  phylogenetic reconstruction and assessing genome quality. Core
                  genes are traditionally identified by the analysis of amino
                  acid similarities among proteomes, but can also be defined
                  using structures, which bear potential in deep clades beyond
                  the twilight zone of amino acids. Despite breakthroughs in
                  accurate AI-driven protein structure prediction, obtaining
                  full 3D structural models on a proteomic scale is still
                  prohibitively slow. Here, we present Unicore, a novel method
                  for identifying structural core genes at a scale suitable for
                  downstream phylogenetic analysis. By applying the ProstT5
                  protein language model to the input proteomes to obtain their
                  3Di structural strings, Unicore saves over three orders of
                  magnitude in runtime compared to a full 3D prediction. Using
                  Foldseek clustering, Unicore identifies single-copy structures
                  universally present in the species and aligns them using
                  Foldmason. These structural core gene alignments are projected
                  back to amino acid information for downstream phylogenetic
                  analysis. We demonstrate that this approach defines core genes
                  with linear run-time scaling over the number of species, up to
                  56 times faster than OrthoFinder, while reconstructing
                  phylogenetic relationships congruent with conventional
                  approaches. Unicore is universally applicable to any given set
                  of taxa, even spanning superkingdoms and overcoming

                  engage in essential molecular functions, yet they are often
                  poorly conserved as assessed by sequence alignment. To
                  understand the seeming paradox of how sequence variability is
                  compatible with persistent function, we examined the
                  functional determinants for a poorly conserved but essential
                  IDR. We show that IDR function depends on two distinct but
                  related properties: sequence- and chemical specificity. While
                  sequence-specificity works via linear binding motifs, chemical
                  specificity reflects the sequence-encoded chemistry of
                  multivalent interactions through amino acids across an IDR.
                  Unexpectedly, a binding motif that is essential in the
                  wild-type IDR can be removed if compensatory changes to the
                  sequence chemistry are made, highlighting the orthogonality
                  and interoperability of both properties and providing a much
                  deeper sequence space compatible with function. Our results

                  in numerous signaling pathways and important drug targets for
                  several diseases. A major shortcoming in GPCR ligand screening
                  is the detection limit for weak binding molecules, which is
                  especially critical for poorly druggable GPCRs. Here, we
                  present a proximity-based screening system for class A GPCRs,
                  which adopts the natural two-step activation mechanism of
                  class B GPCRs. In this approach, class A/B chimeras with the
                  extracellular domain of the class B receptor CRF1R grafted to
                  the transmembrane domain of target class A receptors are
                  stimulated with hybrid ligands. These ligands contain a
                  high-affinity peptide derived from CRF, which recruits the
                  hybrid ligands to the engineered target GPCR, dramatically
                  increasing the local concentration of the test substances. We
                  exemplified this method for neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) and

                  enabling the detection of weakly activating sequences that

                  to probe GPCR activation in the membrane of living cells and
                  may be especially useful for GPCRs for which it has been

                  of highly disordered protein complexes without the formation
                  of three-dimensional structure1. Most naturally occurring
                  proteins are levorotatory (L)-that is, made up only of L-amino
                  acids-imprinting molecular structure and communication with
                  stereochemistry2. By contrast, their mirror-image
                  dextrorotatory (D)-amino acids are rare in nature. Whether
                  disordered protein complexes are truly independent of chiral
                  constraints is not clear. Here, to investigate the chiral
                  constraints of disordered protein-protein interactions, we
                  chose as representative examples a set of five interacting
                  protein pairs covering the disorder-order continuum. By
                  observing the natural ligands and their stereochemical mirror
                  images in free and bound states, we found that chirality was
                  inconsequential in a fully disordered complex. However, if the
                  interaction relied on the ligand undergoing extensive coupled
                  folding and binding, correct stereochemistry was essential.
                  Between these extremes, binding could be observed for the
                  D-ligand with a strength that correlated with disorder in the
                  final complex. These findings have important implications for
                  our understanding of the molecular processes that lead to
                  complex formation, the use of D-peptides in drug discovery and

                  design, which plays a key role in the advancement of
                  therapeutics. A dominant paradigm is to train a model to
                  jointly generate the antibody sequence and the structure as a
                  candidate. However, the joint generation requires the model to
                  generate both the discrete amino acid categories and the
                  continuous 3D coordinates; this limits the space of possible
                  architectures and may lead to suboptimal performance. In
                  response, we propose an antibody sequence-structure decoupling
                  (ASSD) framework, which separates sequence generation and
                  structure prediction. Although our approach is simple, our
                  idea allows the use of powerful neural architectures and
                  demonstrates notable performance improvements. We also find
                  that the widely used non-autoregressive generators promote
                  sequences with overly repeating tokens. Such sequences are
                  both out-of-distribution and prone to undesirable
                  developability properties that can trigger harmful immune
                  responses in patients. To resolve this, we introduce a
                  composition-based objective that allows an efficient trade-off
                  between high performance and low token repetition. ASSD shows
                  improved performance in various antibody design experiments,
                  while the composition-based objective successfully mitigates

                  from non-equilibrium physics, variational inference and
                  stochastic calculus, in this paper we show that many aspects
                  of these models can be understood using the tools of
                  equilibrium statistical mechanics. Using this reformulation,
                  we show that generative diffusion models undergo second-order
                  phase transitions corresponding to symmetry breaking
                  phenomena. We show that these phase-transitions are always in
                  a mean-field universality class, as they are the result of a
                  self-consistency condition in the generative dynamics. We
                  argue that the critical instability that arises from the phase
                  transitions lies at the heart of their generative
                  capabilities, which are characterized by a set of mean-field
                  critical exponents. Finally, we show that the dynamic equation

                  characterizing transmembrane assembly remains challenging for
                  experiments and simulations. Equilibrium molecular dynamics
                  simulations do not cover the time scales required to sample
                  the typical transmembrane assembly. Hence, most studies rely
                  on enhanced sampling schemes that steer the dynamics of
                  transmembrane proteins along a collective variable that should
                  encode all slow degrees of freedom. However, given the
                  complexity of the condensed-phase lipid environment, this is
                  far from trivial, with the consequence that free energy
                  profiles of dimerization can be poorly converged. Here, we
                  introduce an alternative approach, which relies only on
                  simulating short, dynamically unbiased paths, avoiding using
                  collective variables or biasing forces. By merging all paths,
                  we obtain free energy profiles, rates, and mechanisms of

                  association and dissociation of a transmembrane protein in a
                  lipid bilayer, the popular coarse-grained Martini force field.

                  including medicine, environmental monitoring and defence.
                  Stochastic sensing is an approach that relies on the
                  observation of individual binding events between analyte
                  molecules and a single receptor. Engineered transmembrane
                  protein pores are promising sensor elements for stochastic
                  detection, and in their simplest manifestation they produce a
                  fluctuating binary ('on/off') response in the transmembrane
                  electrical current. The frequency of occurrence of the
                  fluctuations reveals the concentration of the analyte, and its
                  identity can be deduced from the characteristic magnitude
                  and/or duration of the fluctuations. Genetically engineered
                  versions of the bacterial pore-forming protein
                  alpha-haemolysin have been used to identify and quantify
                  divalent metal ions in solution. But it is not immediately
                  obvious how versatile binding sites for organic ligands might
                  be obtained by engineering of the pore structure. Here we show
                  that stochastic sensing of organic molecules can be procured
                  from alpha-haemolysin by equipping the channel with an
                  internal, non-covalently bound molecular 'adapter' which
                  mediates channel blocking by the analyte. We use cyclodextrins
                  as the adapters because these fit comfortably inside the pore
                  and present a hydrophobic cavity suitable for binding a
                  variety of organic analytes. Moreover, a single sensing
                  element of this sort can be used to analyse a mixture of
                  organic molecules with different binding characteristics. We
                  envisage the use of other adapters, so that the pore could be
                  'programmed' for a range of sensing functions.},

                  for de novo structure prediction, for probing heterogeneity of
                  interactions with small molecules in the folded state an
                  entirely atomic level description could have advantages in
                  speed and generality. We developed a graph neural network
                  called ChemNet trained to recapitulate correct atomic
                  positions from partially corrupted input structures from the
                  Cambridge Structural Database and the Protein Data Bank; the
                  nodes of the graph are the atoms in the system. ChemNet
                  accurately generates structures of diverse organic small
                  molecules given knowledge of their atom composition and
                  bonding, and given a description of the larger protein

                  protein side chains for protein-small molecule docking.
                  Because ChemNet is rapid and stochastic, ensembles of
                  predictions can be readily generated to map conformational
                  heterogeneity. In enzyme design efforts described here and
                  elsewhere, we find that using ChemNet to assess the accuracy
                  and pre-organization of the designed active sites results in
                  higher success rates and higher activities; we obtain a

                  considerably higher than any pre-deep learning design for this
                  reaction. We anticipate that ChemNet will be widely useful for
                  rapidly generating conformational ensembles of small molecule
                  and small molecule-protein systems, and for designing higher

                  present CANVAS, a computational workflow that introduces a
                  structural lid into a minimal de novo TIM barrel to anchor
                  catalytic residues and form an active-site pocket for
                  enzymatic function. Starting from two de novo TIM barrels, we
                  designed nine variants with distinct lids to form active sites
                  for the Kemp elimination. Experimental testing identified one
                  active variant with catalytic efficiency comparable to
                  previously reported Kemp eliminases. Mutational analyses
                  confirmed that the designed lid is essential for catalysis,
                  while molecular dynamics simulations revealed the importance
                  of lid flexibility for substrate binding. This study reports
                  the first enzymatically active de novo TIM barrel and
                  establishes a platform for designing enzymes from minimal

                  contraction. To perform these various functions, VGCCs are
                  highly regulated. Inactivation comprises a critical mechanism
                  controlling the entry of Ca2+ through these channels and
                  constitutes an important means to regulate cellular
                  excitability, shape action potentials, control intracellular
                  Ca2+ levels, and contribute to long-term potentiation and
                  depression. For CaV1 and CaV2 channel families, inactivation
                  proceeds via two distinct processes. Voltage-dependent
                  inactivation (VDI) reduces Ca2+ entry through the channel in
                  response to sustained or repetitive depolarization, while

                  response to trophic hormone stimulation of steroidogenic cells
                  has been a subject of intensive investigation for
                  approximately six decades. A key observation made very early
                  was that acute regulation of steroid biosynthesis required
                  swift and timely synthesis of a new protein whose role
                  appeared to be involved in the delivery of the substrate for
                  all steroid hormones, cholesterol, from the outer to the inner
                  mitochondrial membrane where the process of steroidogenesis
                  begins. It was quickly learned that this transfer of
                  cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane was the
                  regulated and rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis. Following
                  this observation, the quest for this putative regulator
                  protein(s) began in earnest in the late 1950s. This review
                  provides a history of this quest, the candidate proteins that
                  arose over the years and facts surrounding their rise or
                  decline. Only two have persisted-translocator protein (TSPO)
                  and the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). We
                  present a detailed summary of the work that has been published
                  for each of these two proteins, the specific data that has
                  appeared in support of their role in cholesterol transport and
                  steroidogenesis, and the ensuing observations that have arisen
                  in recent years that have refuted the role of TSPO in this
                  process. We believe that the only viable candidate that has
                  been shown to be indispensable is the StAR protein. Lastly, we
                  provide our view on what may be the most important questions
                  concerning the acute regulation of steroidogenesis that need

                  technical complexity and workload. The inner transmembrane
                  region of MscS can bind lipid molecules, referred to as pore
                  lipids, offering an opportunity for fine-tuning channel
                  properties and improving sensing performance. We leveraged
                  lipid-like molecules, specifically detergents, to replace pore
                  lipids, introducing specific chemical groups into the MscS
                  channel. Using Cryo-EM, we determined the structure of MscS
                  from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, demonstrating that DDM bind
                  stably at the entrance of the hydrophobic pathway.
                  Single-channel recordings confirmed that detergent

                  proteins (TMPs) have been crucial to various cellular

                  Despite their importance, experimental high-resolution
                  structures for TMPs remain underrepresented due to
                  experimental challenges. Given its performance leap, structure
                  predictions have begun to close the gap. However, identifying
                  the membrane regions and topology in three-dimensional
                  structure files on a large scale still requires additional in
                  silico predictions. Here, we introduce TMVisDB to sieve
                  through millions of predicted structures for TMPs. This
                  resource enables both browsing through 46 million predicted
                  TMPs and visualizing them along with their topological
                  annotations without having to tap into costly predictions of

                  activities. Coarse-grained molecular models of intrinsically
                  disordered proteins have been developed to shed light on and
                  predict single-chain properties and phase separation. An RNA
                  model compatible with such models for disordered proteins
                  would enable the study of complex biomolecular mixtures
                  involving RNA. Here, we present a sequence-independent
                  coarse-grained, two-beads-per-nucleotide model of disordered,
                  flexible RNA based on a hydropathy scale. We parametrize the
                  model, which we term CALVADOS-RNA, using a combination of
                  bottom-up and top-down approaches to reproduce local RNA
                  geometry and intramolecular interactions based on atomistic
                  simulations and in vitro experiments. The model
                  semiquantitatively captures several aspects of RNA–RNA and
                  RNA–protein interactions. We examined RNA–RNA interactions by
                  comparing calculated and experimental virial coefficients and
                  nonspecific RNA–protein interaction by studying the reentrant
                  phase behavior of protein–RNA mixtures. We demonstrate the
                  utility of the model by simulating the formation of mixed
                  condensates consisting of the disordered region of MED1 and
                  RNA chains and the selective partitioning of disordered
                  regions from transcription factors into these and compare the
                  results to experiments. Despite the simplicity of our model,
                  we show that it captures several key aspects of protein–RNA
                  interactions and may therefore be used as a baseline model to
                  study several aspects of the biophysics and biology of

                  genetically engineered big up tri, open(5)-3-ketosteroid
                  isomerase (KSI) was designed to conjugate uniquely with this
                  ligand at its Cys-86 through the formation of a disulfide
                  bond. The steady-state protein-ligand binding, mediated by
                  hydrophobic interactions, was confirmed with fluorescence
                  spectra, and the fluorophore-labeled peptide sequence was
                  identified with tandem mass spectra. A comparison of
                  steady-state fluorescence spectra of various
                  fluorophore-labeled KSI mutants reveals that the emission

                  of the decay of the fluorescence anisotropy of the fluorophore
                  indicates the existence of an intramolecular protein-ligand

                  yielded values of anisotropy decay representing the degrees of
                  freedom of the fluorophore related to its location, inside or
                  outside the steroid-binding domain. When 19-norandrostenedione
                  (19-NA) was added to this protein-ligand system, competitive
                  binding between the ligand and the steroid was observed; this

                  cholestatrienol and the naturally occurring dehydroergosterol
                  to mimic the unique properties of native cholesterol in lipid
                  membranes was studied in
                  1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)
                  membranes by electron paramagnetic resonance, nuclear magnetic
                  resonance, and fluorescence spectroscopy. As cholesterol, all
                  analogs undergo fluctuating motions of large amplitude
                  parallel to the bilayer normal. Native cholesterol keeps a
                  strict orientation in the membrane with the long axis parallel
                  to the bilayer normal. Depending on the chemical modification
                  or the position of the label, cholesterol analogs may adopt an
                  "up-side-down" orientation in the membrane or may even
                  fluctuate between "upright" and up-side-down orientation by
                  rotational motions about the short axis not typical for native
                  cholesterol. Those analogs are not able to induce a comparable
                  condensation of phospholipid membranes as known for native
                  cholesterol revealed by 2H nuclear magnetic resonance.
                  However, cholesterol-induced lipid condensation is one of the
                  key properties of native cholesterol, and, therefore, a well
                  suited parameter to assess the potential of steroid analogs to
                  mimic cholesterol. The study points to extreme caution when
                  studying cholesterol behavior by the respective analogs. Among
                  seven analogs investigated, only a spin-labeled cholesterol
                  with the doxyl group at the end of the acyl chain and the
                  fluorophore cholestatrienol mimic cholesterol satisfactorily.
                  Dehydroergosterol has a similar upright orientation as
                  cholesterol and could be used at low concentration (about 1
                  mol \%), at which its lower potential to enhance lipid packing
                  density does not perturb membrane organization.},

                  of whole chains. If both chains in a PPI complex contain large
                  amounts of disorder or accessory domains that do not form the
                  primary domain-domain or domain/peptide interaction, the ipTM
                  score can be lowered significantly. The score then does not
                  accurately represent the accuracy of the structure prediction
                  nor whether the two proteins actually interact. We have solved
                  this problem by: 1) including only residue pairs in the ipTM
                  metric that have good predicted aligned error ( PAE ) scores;
                  2) by adjusting the d 0 parameter (a function of the length of
                  the query sequences) in the TM score equation to include only
                  the number of residues with good interchain PAE s to the
                  aligned residue; and 3) using the PAE value itself and not the
                  probability distributions over the aligned error to calculate
                  the pairwise residue-residue p T M values that go into the
                  ipTM calculation. The first two are crucial in calculating
                  high ipTM s for domain-domain and domain-peptide interactions
                  even in the presence of many hundreds of residues in
                  disordered regions and/or accessory domains. The third allows
                  us to require only the common output json files of AF2 and AF3
                  (including the server output) without having to change the
                  AlphaFold code and without affecting the accuracy. We show in
                  a benchmark that the new score, called ipSAE (interaction
                  prediction Score from Aligned Errors), is able to separate
                  true from false complexes more efficiently than AlphaFold2's
                  ipTM score. The resulting program is freely available at
                  https://github.com/dunbracklab/IPSAE.},

                  nucleotide exchange through diverse engineered allosteric
                  pathways mediated by cooperative networks of intraprotein,
                  protein-ligand and -solvent molecule interactions. Consistent
                  with predictions, the designed protein activities correlated
                  well with the level of plasticity of the networks at flexible
                  transmembrane helical interfaces. Several designs displayed
                  considerably enhanced thermostability and activity compared
                  with related natural receptors. The most stable and active
                  variant crystallized in an unforeseen signalling-active
                  conformation, in excellent agreement with the design models.
                  The allosteric network topologies of the best designs bear
                  limited similarity to those of natural receptors and reveal an
                  allosteric interaction space larger than previously inferred
                  from natural proteins. The approach should prove useful for

                  interconversions between multiple conformations occurring at
                  micro-to millisecond (µs-ms) timescales. A lack of
                  standardized, large-scale experimental data has hindered
                  obtaining a more predictive understanding of these motions.
                  After curating >100 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
                  relaxation datasets, we realized an observable for µs-ms
                  motion was hiding in plain sight. Millisecond motions can
                  cause NMR signals to broaden beyond detection, leaving some
                  residues not assigned in the chemical shift datasets of
                  ∼10,000 proteins deposited in the Biological Magnetic
                  Resonance Data Bank (BMRB)1. We made the bold assumption that
                  residues missing assignments are exchange-broadened due to
                  µs-ms motions, and trained various deep learning models to
                  predict missing assignments as markers for such dynamics.
                  Strikingly, these models also predict µs-ms motion directly
                  measured in NMR relaxation experiments. The best of these
                  models, which we named Dyna-1, leverages an intermediate layer
                  of the multimodal language model ESM-32. Notably, dynamics
                  directly linked to biological function — including enzyme
                  catalysis and ligand binding — are particularly well predicted
                  by Dyna-1, which parallels our findings that residues with
                  µs-ms motions are highly conserved. We anticipate the datasets
                  and models presented here will be transformative in unlocking
                  the common language of dynamics and function.},

                  constrained by the cost and scalability of DNA synthesis.
                  Here, we present OMEGA (Oligo-based Multiplexed Efficient Gene

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of protein-ligand interactions remains a
                  cornerstone challenge in drug discovery. AlphaFold3 (AF3), a
                  recent breakthrough Diffusion Transformer model, holds
                  significant promise for structural biology, but its
                  performance across diverse pharmaceutical applications
                  requires systematic evaluation. In this study, we
                  comprehensively benchmark AF3's capabilities using carefully
                  curated datasets, examining its performance in binary
                  protein-ligand complexes, apo/holo structural variations,
                  GPCR-ligand conformations, ternary systems, and inhibitor
                  affinity prediction. Our analysis reveals that AF3 excels at
                  predicting static protein-ligand interactions with minimal
                  conformational changes, significantly outperforming
                  traditional docking methods in side-chain orientation
                  accuracy. However, we identify critical limitations: AF3
                  struggles with protein-ligand complexes involving significant
                  conformational changes (>5A RMSD), demonstrates a persistent
                  bias toward active GPCR conformations regardless of ligand
                  type, performs poorly on ternary complex prediction, and lacks
                  reliable affinity ranking capability. Notably, AF3's
                  performance declined significantly on structures released
                  after its training cutoff date, suggesting potential
                  memorization rather than physical understanding of molecular
                  interactions. We explored AF3's practical utility through
                  applications in chemoproteomics data interpretation, drug
                  resistance mutation prediction, and kinome profiling
                  simulation. AF3 demonstrated value as a "true-hit binary
                  interaction modeler," capable of generating reliable
                  structural models for experimentally validated binding pairs.
                  However, its ranking metrics showed minimal correlation with
                  experimental binding affinities and limited ability to
                  differentiate across the kinome, highlighting the need for
                  integration with physics-based scoring methods. Our findings
                  indicate that while AF3 represents a significant advancement
                  in protein-ligand structure prediction, it requires
                  complementary approaches to address its limitations in
                  conformational sampling, affinity ranking, and complex system
                  modeling. Recent developments like YDS Ternoplex suggest that
                  enhanced sampling techniques can overcome some of these
                  limitations. The optimal strategy for leveraging AF3 in drug
                  discovery likely involves its integration into hybrid
                  computational pipelines that combine AI-based prediction with
                  physics-based refinement and experimental validation.},

                  (GPCRs) involves a population shift from inactive to active
                  receptor conformations in response to the binding of ligand
                  agonists. Two possible kinetic mechanisms for this population
                  shift are induced fit and conformational selection. The two
                  mechanisms differ in the temporal sequence of binding events
                  and conformational changes: Ligand bindings occurs prior to
                  the change from the inactive to the active receptor
                  conformation in the induced-fit mechanism, and after the
                  conformational change in the conformational-selection
                  mechanism. In this article, we discuss the current evidence
                  from experiments that probe the binding kinetics of GPCRs to
                  identify the allosteric mechanism. For the peptide-activated
                  neurotensin receptor, the modeling of kinetic data from
                  stopped-flow mixing experiments indicates an induced-fit
                  mechanism [1]. The conformational exchange rates of the
                  induced-fit mechanism obtained from this modeling agree with
                  rates measured by saturation transfer difference NMR
                  experiments of the peptide-receptor complex, which
                  corroborates the mechanism. For the small-molecule-activated
                  β2-andrenergic receptor, an induced-fit mechanism has been
                  inferred from a comparison of ligand-association rates for the
                  inactive and the active receptor conformation [2]. A
                  stabilization of the active receptor conformation by G
                  proteins or nanobodies leads to a decrease of ligand
                  association rates, which indicates that ligand binding occurs
                  in the inactive conformation and, thus, prior to the change
                  from the inactive to the active conformation as in the
                  induced-fit mechanism. A structural explanation for the
                  induced-fit mechanism of the β2-andrenergic receptor is a
                  closed lid over the binding site that blocks ligand entry in
                  the active conformation. Since constriction and closing of the
                  ligand-binding site in the active conformation is rather
                  common for small-molecule-activated and peptide-activated
                  GPCRs, induced fit likely is shared as allosteric mechanism by
                  these GPCRs.},

                  self-assembling proteins have advanced substantially over the
                  past decade, they primarily focus on designing static
                  structures. Here we characterize three distinct
                  computationally designed protein assemblies that exhibit
                  unanticipated structural diversity arising from flexibility in
                  their subunits. Cryo-EM single-particle reconstructions and
                  native mass spectrometry reveal two distinct architectures for
                  two assemblies, while six cryo-EM reconstructions for the
                  third likely represent a subset of its solution-phase
                  structures. Structural modeling and molecular dynamics
                  simulations indicate that constrained flexibility within the
                  subunits of each assembly promotes a defined range of
                  architectures rather than nonspecific aggregation. Redesigning
                  the flexible region in one building block rescues the intended
                  monomorphic assembly. These findings highlight structural
                  flexibility as a powerful design principle, enabling

                  posited by the somatic mutation theory (SMT). In this

                  protective nutrient and signaling ion — particularly as
                  connected to reactive nitrogen oxides. Aside from limited
                  insights into nitrate uptake and storage, foundational nitrate
                  biology has lagged. Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors
                  can address this gap with real-time imaging. However, imaging
                  technologies for mammalian cell applications remain rare.
                  Here, we set out to design and engineer a two-domain chimera
                  fusing the split green fluorescent protein EGFP and the
                  nitrate recognition domain NreA from Staphylococcus carnosus.
                  Over 7 rounds of directed evolution, 15 mutations were
                  accumulated resulting in the functional biosensor NitrOFF.
                  NitrOFF has a high degree of allosteric communication between
                  the domains reflected in a turn-off intensiometric response
                  (Kd≈ 9 μM). This was further reinforced by X-ray crystal
                  structures of apo and nitrate bound NitrOFF, which revealed
                  that the two domains undergo a large-scale conformational
                  rearrangement that changes the relative positioning of the
                  EGFP and NreA domains by 68.4°. Such a dramatic difference was
                  triggered by the formation of a long helix at the engineered
                  linker connecting the two domains, peeling the β7 strand off
                  the EGFP and thus extinguishing the fluorescence upon nitrate
                  binding. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we highlighted the
                  utility of this first-generation biosensor to monitor
                  exogenous nitrate uptake and modulation in a human embryonic

                  descriptions consisting of constellations of catalytic residue
                  functional groups around reaction transition state(s), and
                  seeks to generate protein structures that can accurately hold
                  the site in place. Highly active enzymes have been designed
                  starting from such descriptions using the generative AI method
                  RFdiffusion, but there are two current methodological
                  limitations. First, the geometry of the active site can only
                  be specified at the residue level, so for each catalytic
                  residue functional group placed around the reaction transition
                  state, the possible locations of the residue backbone must be
                  enumerated by building side chain rotamers back from the
                  functional group. Second, the location of the catalytic
                  residues along the sequence must be specified in advance,
                  which considerably limits the space of solutions which can be
                  sampled. Here we describe a new deep generative method,
                  RoseTTAFold diffusion 2 (RFdiffusion2), that solves both
                  problems, enabling enzymes to be designed from sequence
                  agnostic descriptions of functional group locations without
                  inverse rotamer generation. We first evaluate RFdiffusion2 on
                  an in silico enzyme design benchmark of 41 diverse active
                  sites and find that it is able to successfully build proteins
                  scaffolding all 41 sites, compared to 16/41 with prior
                  state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Next, we design
                  enzymes around three diverse catalytic sites and characterize
                  the designs experimentally; in each case we identify active
                  catalysts in testing less than 96 sequences. RFdiffusion2
                  demonstrates the potential of atomic resolution generative
                  models for the design of de novo enzymes directly from their
                  reaction mechanisms.}

                  challenging despite advances in deep learning. The design of
                  proteins that bind to small molecules has been particularly
                  difficult because it requires simultaneous optimization of
                  protein sequence, protein structure, and ligand conformation.
                  Despite their promise, current deep-learning algorithms have
                  struggled to navigate this landscape, precluding the zero- or
                  few-shot design of binders. Here we show that the combination
                  of two neural networks in an iterative design algorithm can
                  create small-molecule binding proteins from scratch with high
                  accuracy. To optimize a design in the joint distribution of
                  sequence, structure, and ligand conformation, we use a pair of
                  neural networks that were trained on reciprocal tasks. We
                  train and use a graph neural network, LASErMPNN, to design
                  protein sequence given protein-ligand co-structure, and we use
                  RoseTTAFold-All Atom (RFAA) to predict protein-ligand
                  co-structure given protein sequence. We iteratively apply
                  these two networks to design proteins that bind the drug,
                  exatecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor that is prone to
                  inactivation by hydrolysis9. Each of four experimentally
                  tested designs bound the drug, with the lowest dissociation
                  constant (Kd) near 100 nM. The hit rate and highest affinity
                  design each surpassed the current state-of-the-art method by
                  5- and 70-fold, respectively. We further show that LASErMPNN
                  can improve upon its own designs in a manner resembling
                  chain-of-thought reasoning. Without experimental input,
                  LASErMPNN suggested two mutations that increased affinity by
                  over two orders of magnitude (Kd = 1.2 +/- 0.2 nM). Designs
                  were selective, structurally accurate, and achieved their
                  intended purpose to protect the drug from hydrolysis. Our work
                  describes a recipe for using neural networks to automate the
                  design of high affinity small-molecule binding proteins, which
                  should have wide application in the creation of novel
                  drug-delivery vehicles, antidotes, sensors, and enzymes.}

                  essential contributor of conformational entropy and affects
                  processes such as folding, stability and molecular
                  interactions. Structure determination experiments and
                  prediction tools such as AlphaFold generally fail to capture
                  or represent the conformational heterogeneity of proteins in
                  solution. Experiments can be used to study side-chain
                  flexibility, but cannot be applied at scale, and most
                  prediction methods focus on reconstructing the minimum free
                  energy state rather than an ensemble representing side-chain
                  configurations. Here, we use AlphaFold2 and its internal
                  side-chain representations to develop AF2χ that predicts
                  side-chain χ-angle distributions and generates structural
                  ensembles. We extensively benchmark AF2χ predictions using
                  experimental NMR 3 J -couplings and s 2 order parameters, as
                  well as dihedral angle distributions derived from collections
                  of experimental structures, demonstrating the accuracy of AF2χ
                  in generating accurate side-chain ensembles. We also compare
                  the accuracy of AF2χ with molecular dynamics simulations and
                  recent machine learning models aimed to generate
                  conformational ensembles and show that AF2χ provides
                  state-of-the-art accuracy orders of magnitude faster than
                  molecular simulations. With its speed and accuracy, AF2χ
                  offers a strong complementary option to simulations and
                  rotamer library approaches, making it particularly valuable
                  for applications such as protein design, ligand docking and
                  interpretation of biophysical experiments.}

                  industries internationally. One important set of criticisms
                  concerns the amount of money that music creators receive for
                  the recorded music that is distributed on these services. Many
                  claim that music streaming has made it harder than before for

                  and discusses some significant problems of argument and
                  evidence surrounding these criticisms, as follows: (a) a
                  dubious focus on ‘per-stream’ rates offered by music streaming
                  services, (b) a failure to see streaming services as part of
                  wider systems of music and ownership, (c) tendencies towards
                  simplification when systemic problems are taken into account,
                  and (d) the limited evidence provided when commentators claim,
                  imply or assume that the system has become notably less just.
                  It then discusses debates concerning what might be done to
                  improve the system, especially whether ‘user-centric’ systems
                  of payment might be adopted, instead of the current ‘pro-rata’
                  system. The article suggests that more musicians rather than
                  fewer might now be able to earn money from recorded music than
                  in preceding recorded-music systems. But it also proposes that
                  the current system retains the striking inequalities and
                  generally poor working conditions that characterised its
                  predecessors, and that better debate requires greater
                  transparency about usage and payment on the part of streaming

                  was used to collect data about the respondents’ backgrounds

                  role and use of social media. Contact between the researcher
                  and the musicians was created using video call approaches. The
                  musicians are motivated to use social media to express
                  themselves, connect with other musicians, and expand their
                  audiences. Social media platforms allow audiences to be more

                  power dynamics through three of the most important markets
                  that Spotify—the leading audio streaming platform—is embedded
                  within: the music market; the advertising market; and the
                  finance market. It does so through the lens of the playlist.
                  Playlists can be seen as a central example of how platforms
                  like Spotify employ curation or “curatorial power” to mediate
                  markets in the attempt to advance their own interests. At the
                  same time, playlists are an outcome of the conflicting
                  pressures and tensions between these markets. As such, they
                  provide a lens through which to view broader structural
                  dynamics within the platform economy. As this case study of
                  Spotify demonstrates, platform “power” is an always unstable

                  excitable cells. In nature, ion channel function is customized
                  by modulatory proteins that have evolved to fulfill distinct
                  physiological needs. Yet, engineering synthetic modulators
                  that precisely tune ion channel function is challenging. One
                  example involves the voltage-gated sodium (Na V ) channel that
                  initiates the action potential, and whose dysfunction
                  amplifies late/persistent sodium current ( I NaL ), a
                  commonality that underlies various human diseases including
                  cardiac arrhythmias and epilepsy. Here, using a computational
                  protein design platform, we engineered a de novo peptide
                  modulator, ELIXIR, that binds Na V channels with submicromolar
                  affinity. Functional analysis revealed an unexpected
                  selectivity in inhibiting ‘pathogenic’ I NaL and confirmed its
                  effectiveness in reversing Na V dysfunction linked to both
                  cardiac arrhythmias and epilepsy in cellular and murine
                  models. These findings exemplify the efficacy of de novo
                  protein design for engineering synthetic ion channel
                  modulators and sets the stage for rational design of future
                  therapeutic approaches.}

                  methods to predict the distribution of relative orientations
                  of two domains tethered by a flexible linker. The range of
                  interdomain distances and orientations (poses) of such
                  domain-linker-domain (D-L-D) proteins can play an important
                  role in protein function, allostery, aggregation, and the
                  thermodynamics of binding. The CASP16 Conformational Ensembles
                  Experiment included two challenges to predict the interdomain
                  pose distribution of a Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) D-L-D
                  construct, called ZLBT-C, in which two of SpA’s five nearly
                  identical domains are connected by either (1) a six-residue
                  wild-type (WT) linker (kadnkf), or (2) an all-glycine (Gly6)
                  linker. The wild-type linker has a highly conserved sequence
                  and is thought to contribute to the energetic barrier for
                  binding with host antibodies. Ground truth was provided by
                  nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) residual dipolar coupling
                  (RDC) data on WT protein and small angle X-ray scattering
                  (SAXS) data on both proteins in solution. Twenty-five
                  predictor groups submitted 35 sets of predicted conformational
                  distributions, in the form of population-weighted finite
                  ensembles of discrete structures. Unlike traditional CASP
                  assessments that compare predicted atomic models to
                  experimental atomic models, the accuracy of these predictions
                  was assessed by back-calculating NMR RDCs and SAXS curves from
                  each ensemble of atomic models and comparing these results to
                  respective experimental data. Accuracy was also assessed by
                  using kernelization to compare ensembles to the continuous
                  orientational distributions optimally fit to experimental
                  data. In our assessment, predictions spanned a wide range of
                  accuracy, but none were close fits to the combined NMR and

                  steering} to determine the optimal pathway by which a filament
                  may knot or unknot while subject to a given set of physics.
                  The method involves measuring the knotoid spectrum of a space
                  curve projected onto many surfaces and computing the mean
                  unravelling number of those projections. Several perturbations
                  of a curve can be generated stochastically, e.g. using the
                  Langevin equation or crankshaft moves, and a gradient can be
                  followed that maximises or minimises the topological
                  complexity. We apply this method to a polymer model based on a
                  growing self-avoiding tangent-sphere chain, which can be made
                  to model proteins by imposing a constraint that the bending
                  and twisting angles between successive spheres must maintain
                  the distribution found in naturally occurring protein
                  structures. We show that without these protein-like geometric
                  constraints, topologically optimised polymers typically form
                  alternating torus knots and composites thereof, similar to the
                  stochastic knots predicted for long DNA. However, when the
                  geometric constraints are imposed on the system, the frequency
                  of twist knots increases, similar to the observed abundance of
                  twist knots in protein structures.},

                  membrane-contact sites and are thought to mediate the bulk
                  transfer of lipids from a donor membrane, typically the
                  endoplasmic reticulum, to an acceptor membrane, such as that
                  of the cell or an organelle1. Although BLTPs are fundamentally
                  important for a wide array of cellular functions, their
                  architecture, composition and lipid-transfer mechanisms remain
                  poorly characterized. Here we present the subunit composition
                  and the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the native
                  LPD-3 BLTP complex isolated from transgenic Caenorhabditis
                  elegans. LPD-3 folds into an elongated, rod-shaped tunnel of
                  which the interior is filled with ordered lipid molecules that
                  are coordinated by a track of ionizable residues that line one
                  side of the tunnel. LPD-3 forms a complex with two previously
                  uncharacterized proteins, one of which we have named Spigot
                  and the other of which remains unnamed. Spigot interacts with
                  the N-terminal end of LPD-3 where lipids are expected to enter
                  the tunnel, and experiments in multiple model systems indicate
                  that Spigot has a conserved role in BLTP function. Our LPD-3
                  complex structural data reveal protein-lipid interactions that
                  suggest a model for how the native LPD-3 complex mediates bulk
                  lipid transport and provides a foundation for mechanistic
                  studies of BLTPs.},

                  deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by a number of structurally
                  related organic solvents has been investigated. In all the
                  solvents investigated, denaturation is accompanied by 35–50\%
                  increase in absorbance (at 259 mμ) and a decrease in optical
                  rotation (at 436 mμ) of 200–350 °. The following observations
                  have been made: (a) The effectiveness of the denaturant
                  increases with both chain length and increasing hydrocarbon
                  content. Thus ethyl and propyl alcohols were found to be more
                  effective than methanol. (b) The alkyl-substituted solvents
                  N,N′-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, and
                  tetramethylurea are the most effective denaturants among the
                  various solvents employed. The midpoints of the denaturation
                  transition due to these solvents in the presence of 1–5 ×
                  10−2M salt, range from 19 to 27 mole \% (57–62 vol.\%), and
                  the changes produced in optical rotation (at 436 mμ) upon
                  denaturation are of the order of −300 to −350 °. (c)
                  N,N′-dimethylformamide is a more effective DNA denaturant than
                  formamide. (d) Increasing the hydroxyl content of the solvent,
                  on the other hand, had no significant effect; the denaturation
                  midpoints in methanol-water and ethylene glycol-water mixtures
                  (in the presence of 0.5–5 × 10−2M salt) occur at 80 ± 1 mole
                  \% (90 ± 2 vol.\%) of the nonaqueous component. These
                  observations demonstrate the importance of hydrophobic forces
                  and argue against the assignment of the stability of the
                  aqueous configuration of DNA solely to hydrogen bonds.Except
                  in dimethyl sulfoxide, DNA denaturation by the organic
                  solvents employed could be largely reversed by water in the
                  presence of electrolyte.},

                  tools for designing proteins purpose-built to solve problems
                  in medicine, agriculture, and industrial processes. Recent
                  work has trained ever larger language models, but there has
                  been little systematic study of the optimal training
                  distributions and the influence of model scale on the
                  sequences generated by PLMs. We introduce the ProGen3 family
                  of sparse generative PLMs, and we develop compute-optimal
                  scaling laws to scale up to a 46B-parameter model pre-trained
                  on 1.5T amino acid tokens. ProGen3’s pre-training data is
                  sampled from an optimized data distribution over the Profluent
                  Protein Atlas v1, a carefully curated dataset of 3.4B
                  full-length proteins. We evaluate for the first time in the
                  wet lab the influence of model scale on the sequences

                  viable proteins for a much wider diversity of protein
                  families. Finally, we find both computationally and
                  experimentally that larger models are more responsive to
                  alignment with laboratory data, resulting in improved protein
                  fitness prediction and sequence generation capabilities. These

                  relational phenomenon emerging through the interplay of user
                  practices, technological affordances and cultural meanings.
                  Drawing on qualitative interviews and online ethnography with
                  indie music enthusiasts in China, the research explores two
                  key aspects of streaming music consumption to examine music’s
                  materiality: playlisting practices and users’ reflexive
                  interactions with recommendation algorithms. The findings
                  reveal a co-evolutionary relationship between user practices
                  and technological affordances, where both users and algorithms
                  actively shape the experience and materiality of music.
                  Playlist curation emerges as a new form of meaning-making,
                  transforming intangible streaming music into personalised,
                  structured objects; while user-algorithmic interplay creates a
                  dynamic environment where music perception and engagement are
                  constantly negotiated. These cases illuminate a new perception
                  of music materiality – one that is constantly emergent and
                  relationally constituted. The article contributes to broader
                  debates on the digitalisation of culture, the changing nature
                  of cultural consumption, and the role of technology in shaping
                  cultural experiences. It invites a re-examination of the

                  yet are synthesized through notoriously long metabolic
                  pathways. It has been proposed that the molecular evolution of
                  such pathways must have required each step to increase the
                  capacity of its product to condense and order phospholipids.
                  Here, we carry out a systematic analysis of the ergosterol
                  pathway that leverages the yeast vacuole's capacity to phase
                  separate into ordered membrane domains. In the post-synthetic
                  steps specific to ergosterol biosynthesis, we find that
                  successive modifications act to oscillate ordering capacity,
                  settling on a level that supports phase separation while
                  retaining fluidity of the resulting domains. Simulations
                  carried out with each intermediate showed how conformers in
                  the sterol's alkyl tail are capable of modulating long-range
                  ordering of phospholipids, which could underlie changes in
                  phase behavior. Our results indicate that the complexity of
                  sterol metabolism could have resulted from the need to balance
                  lipid interactions required for membrane organization.},

                  acid sequences, which determine their three-dimensional
                  structures and, consequently, their functions in all living
                  organisms. Therefore, generative protein modeling necessitates
                  a multimodal approach to simultaneously model, understand, and
                  generate both sequences and structures. However, existing
                  methods typically use separate models for each modality,
                  limiting their ability to capture the intricate relationships
                  between sequence and structure. This results in suboptimal
                  performance in tasks that requires joint understanding and
                  generation of both modalities. In this paper, we introduce
                  DPLM-2, a multimodal protein foundation model that extends
                  discrete diffusion protein language model (DPLM) to
                  accommodate both sequences and structures. To enable
                  structural learning with the language model, 3D coordinates
                  are converted to discrete tokens using a lookup-free
                  quantization-based tokenizer. By training on both experimental
                  and high-quality synthetic structures, DPLM-2 learns the joint
                  distribution of sequence and structure, as well as their
                  marginals and conditionals. We also implement an efficient
                  warm-up strategy to exploit the connection between large-scale
                  evolutionary data and structural inductive biases from
                  pre-trained sequence-based protein language models. Empirical
                  evaluation shows that DPLM-2 can simultaneously generate
                  highly compatible amino acid sequences and their corresponding
                  3D structures eliminating the need for a two-stage generation
                  approach. Moreover, DPLM-2 demonstrates competitive
                  performance in various conditional generation tasks, including
                  folding, inverse folding, and scaffolding with multimodal
                  motif inputs, as well as providing structure-aware
                  representations for predictive tasks.}

                  actively maintained concentration gradients of lipids between
                  bilayer leaflets, termed lipid asymmetry. 1–3 Lipid asymmetry
                  has been linked to many cellular processes 4,5 , but the
                  mechanisms that connect lipid trans-bilayer concentration
                  gradients to cellular functions are poorly understood. Here we
                  systematically map the cellular processes affected by
                  dysregulation of lipid asymmetry by knocking out flippases,
                  floppases, and scramblases in mammalian cells. We identify
                  broad alterations to core metabolic pathways including
                  nutrient uptake, neutral lipid turnover, pentose phosphate
                  pathway and glycolysis. Lipidomics, respirometry, lipid and
                  metabolic imaging, and live-cell calorimetry revealed elevated
                  neutral lipid and ATP consumption rates which are coupled with
                  increased heat loss per unit of biomass synthesized despite
                  slower growth. This suggests that compensatory maintenance of
                  lipid asymmetry strains the cellular energy budget, inducing a
                  shift from a growth-promoting anabolic to a more energy-using
                  catabolic state. Our data indicate that lipid asymmetry and
                  its active maintenance is key for proper cell energetics,
                  highlighting its putative role as a cellular store of
                  potential energy akin to proton and ion transmembrane

  abstract     = {Drawing on Mark Katz’s notion of phonographic effects—where
                  musicians, during the advent of early recording technology,
                  altered their style of play to be better captured by
                  microphones—this article explores some of the “platform
                  effects” that arise in the shift to platformization and how
                  cultural goods and user practices are re-formatted in the
                  process. In particular, I examine the case of the music
                  streaming service Spotify to think through the variety of
                  means, sonic, and otherwise, that artists, labels, and other
                  platform stakeholders use to “optimize” music to respond to
                  the pressures platformization creates. I develop a typology of
                  strategies—sonic optimization, data optimization, and
                  infrastructural optimization—to consider the creative and
                  logistical challenges optimization poses for platforms,
                  artists, and users alike. From creating playlist friendly
                  songs to musical spam to artificial play counts, I use the
                  blurry lines these cases create to explore the tensions
                  between the competing needs of platform providers, content
                  producers, and users. I argue that music, as data, adds
                  pressure on musicians and producers to think and act like
                  software developers and coders, treating their music not just
                  as songs that need to reach listeners, but as an intermingling
                  of sonic content and coded metadata that needs to be prepared
                  and readied for discovery. This optimization of culture, and
                  the pressures it creates, affects not just musicians, but
                  content producers of all kinds (e.g., video, podcasts, apps,
                  books, etc.) who are forced to negotiate their relationships
                  digital culture and the platforms through which it circulates.},

                  using nanopore biosensors is critical for disease diagnosis
                  and other biomedical applications. Processing large, complex
                  single-channel translocation data streams poses a significant
                  challenge for peptide analyte classification. Here, we present
                  a supervised deep learning data processing pipeline for
                  peptide classification from translocation events. The first
                  stage employs a convolutional and recurrent neural network,
                  adapted from the Deep-Channel multi-channel classifier, to
                  accurately classify raw current recordings into discrete
                  conductance states, including partially blocked
                  sub-conductance intermediates. The second stage, peptide
                  classification, utilizes a novel branched input network with a
                  temporal convolutional network for processing translocation
                  event conductance state sequences and a dense network for
                  incorporating computed event-level and global kinetic
                  features. Using idealized simulated multi-state translocation
                  data for seven peptides, we demonstrate high classification
                  accuracy (0.99) when global features are included alongside
                  event-level features. For classifying mixture samples, where
                  only event-level features are applicable, performance is more
                  modest (0.68 accuracy). Peptide mixture predictions showed
                  reasonable accuracy (MAE 0.045-0.161), although
                  misclassification resulted in false positives. Event
                  stochasticity and the fact that some peptides possessed
                  similar kinetic parameters posed challenging for event-level
                  prediction. However, vote aggregation from translocation event
                  streams achieves perfect 100\% accuracy, when predicting pure
                  peptide samples. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates a
                  robust deep learning framework for nanopore peptide
                  classification using simulated data, laying the groundwork for
                  classifying peptides from complex mixtures using real

                  modeling efforts. Recent studies suggest that AlphaFold (AF) -
                  a revolutionary deep learning model for biomolecular structure
                  prediction - has implicitly learned an approximate biophysical
                  energy function. While many researchers highly rely on
                  AF-derived scores for structure evaluation, existing
                  AlphaFold2-based implementations require iterative refinement
                  of the input structure, leading to biased scoring. To address
                  this limitation, we adapted AlphaFold3 into a score-only
                  model, AF3Score, by directly feeding input coordinates into
                  the confidence head while bypassing the diffusion-based
                  structure module. AF3Score demonstrates robust performance in
                  structural quality assessment across diverse systems including
                  monomeric proteins, protein-protein complexes, de novo
                  designed binders, and fold-switching proteins. In benchmarking
                  designed binder screening, AF3Score outperformed
                  state-of-the-art methods for 8 out of 10 targets. Moreover,
                  combining AF3Score with AlphaFold2-derived methods
                  significantly improved the enrichment of experimentally
                  validated binders, increasing the success rate from 15.2\% to
                  31.6\%. Additionally, AF3Score effectively identified stable
                  conformations in fold-switching proteins, whereas AlphaFold
                  predominantly predicted only the dominant fold. These findings
                  highlight the broad applicability of AF3Score, from
                  high-throughput screening in de novo binder design to
                  filtering docking-generated poses and molecular dynamics (MD)
                  trajectories.}

                  often rely on known unbound (Apo) protein structures, which
                  may differ significantly from their bound (Holo) forms. Modern

                  allow generating ensembles of functionally relevant protein

                  could improve the outcomes of the classical rigid
                  protein-protein docking. Here we sampled conformations of the
                  protein subunits in 30 complexes from the novel PLINDER
                  dataset with two state-of-the-art ML-based techniques and

                  showed that such conformational sampling rarely produces

                  corresponding Apo ones. Moreover, even when such conformations
                  are generated, none of the tested scoring functions were able

                  The results demonstrate a stepwise cleavage that is

                  the model’s confidence in its ability to accurately represent
                  molecular properties is a critical flaw—akin to using a

                  A key contributor to this performance issue is the models’
                  failure to learn the underlying biology from unevenly

                  reliability. We believe that our robust approach to screening
                  embeddings prior to making biological inferences, stands to

                  sequences capable of folding into predefined tertiary
                  structures and quaternary assemblies. It has become widely
                  used due to its high success rates when working with synthetic
                  topologies rich in secondary structure. Here, we show degraded
                  performance on the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs)
                  of antibodies, with designs frequently failing to resemble
                  native antibodies or failing to refold into the designed
                  conformations. We also show that this underperformance can be
                  rescued by ensembling its predictions with those from the
                  antibody-specific protein language model AbLang, which designs
                  exclusively using sequence information learned from large
                  databases of antibody sequences. Finally, we tested 96
                  trastuzumab variants with CDRH3 loops redesigned by the
                  ensembled ProteinMPNN+AbLang method and found that it
                  generated thirty-six HER2 binders, compared to three out of 96
                  designs generated by ProteinMPNN alone. The data highlight the
                  value of incorporating additional restraints derived from
                  language models during structure-based sequence design of
                  antibodies.}

                  immobilization, as well as for the development of
                  next-generation therapeutics such as antibody drug-conjugates.
                  Among the available methods, enzymatic post-translational
                  modification of short protein tags offers precision,
                  stability, and modularity. However, broader application is
                  often limited by complex substrate syntheses, the requirement
                  of long or rigid recognition tags, and limited reaction
                  efficiencies. Here, we present ADDing, a straightforward
                  enzymatic method for functionalizing proteins with click
                  chemistry handles using the flavin transferase ApbE. We
                  discovered that, given a dedicated adenine diphosphate
                  derivative (ADD) substrate, the enzyme attaches a
                  phosphoribosyl moiety bearing bioorthogonal handles to
                  proteins featuring a DxxxGAT amino acid motif. As the
                  substrates can easily be enzymatically synthesized from NAD
                  and inexpensive precursors, ADDing click handles can be
                  performed in a streamlined, one-pot workflow combining
                  substrate synthesis and protein conjugation. ADDing allows
                  rapid, high-yield functionalization of proteins featuring the
                  recognition tag at either terminus or internal loops and is
                  compatible with copper and copper free azide-alkyne
                  cycloaddition reactions. To demonstrate its broad
                  applicability, we performed a wide variety of protein
                  functionalizations, including fluorescent labeling,
                  protein-protein, protein-DNA conjugation, and protein
                  immobilization. This versatile technology thus holds great
                  potential for chemical biology and the production of
                  biological therapeutics.},

                  between them, and demonstrate that the conformational
                  landscape can be modulated by orthosteric ligands and
                  allosteric mutations. Physics-based simulations are in

                  (ipTM), via backpropagation. However, these metrics do not

                  contradictory decrease in the test line (T) intensity and
                  false-negative results. The hook effect is mainly associated
                  with the loss of T, and research focuses on minimizing this
                  effect. Nevertheless, the control line (C) intensity is also
                  affected at higher analyte concentrations, undesirably
                  influencing the T/C ratio in LFIA readers. The main aim of
                  this work is to identify and understand these high antigen
                  concentration effects in order to develop ubiquitous
                  strategies to interpret and mitigate such effects. Four
                  complementary experiments were performed: performance
                  assessment of three different allergen LFIAs (two for
                  hazelnut, one for peanut) over 0.075-3500 ppm, LFIAs with C
                  only, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding experiments on
                  the immobilized control antibody, and smartphone video
                  recording of LFIAs during their development. As antigen
                  concentrations increase, the C signal decreases before the T
                  signal does, suggesting that distinct mechanisms underlie
                  these intensity reductions. Reduced binding at the C occurred
                  even in the absence of T, so the upfront T does not explain
                  the loss of C. SPR confirmed that the C antibody favors
                  binding with free labeled antibody compared with a labeled
                  antibody-analyte complex, indicating that in antigen excess,
                  binding is reduced at C before T. Finally, a smartphone-based
                  video method was developed for dynamically monitoring the LFIA
                  development in real time to distinguish between different
                  concentration-dependent effects. Digitally analyzing the data
                  allows clear differentiation of highly positive samples and
                  false-negative samples and can indicate whether the LFIA is in
                  the dynamic working range or at critically high
                  concentrations. The aim of this work is to identify and
                  understand such high antigen concentration effects in order to
                  develop ubiquitous strategies to interpret and mitigate such

                  substantial dynamics, it may be difficult to characterize the
                  conformational ensembles of multi-domain proteins by
                  simulations. Here, we present a coarse-grained model for
                  multi-domain proteins that is both fast and provides an
                  accurate description of the global conformational properties
                  in solution. We show that the accuracy of a
                  one-bead-per-residue coarse-grained model depends on how the
                  interaction sites in the folded domains are represented.
                  Specifically, we find excessive domain-domain interactions if
                  the interaction sites are located at the position of the Cα
                  atoms. We also show that if the interaction sites are located

                  cells by inhibiting oncogenic signaling pathways such as Ras
                  1–4 . This renders them susceptible to resistance and limits
                  their long-term clinical efficacy 4–10 . Engineered protein
                  circuits 11–25 have been envisioned as an alternative to
                  pharmacological inhibition that directly rewires oncogenic
                  activity to cell death. However, it has remained unclear
                  whether engineered protein circuits can potently and safely
                  treat cancers. Here, we show that Ras-targeting circuits can
                  accurately discriminate between cancer and non-cancer cells,
                  circumvent intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms that
                  limit pharmacological inhibitors, and suppress cancer in vivo
                  . These circuits combine three modules: a protease-based
                  sensor that responds to a broad spectrum of clinically
                  relevant Ras mutations, an optional protease amplifier, and
                  protease-triggered cell death effectors. These effectors can
                  flexibly trigger either non-inflammatory apoptosis or
                  immunogenic pyroptosis, which has been shown to extend
                  therapeutic effects beyond transfected cells 26,27 . The
                  resulting sense-kill circuits can be safely, efficiently, and
                  transiently delivered to cells as mRNA in lipid nanoparticles
                  (LNPs). The circuits exhibited potent efficacy against
                  Ras-mutant human cancer cell lines with minimal off-target
                  killing of wild-type Ras cells. In immunocompetent mice
                  bearing aggressive, multifocal Ras-driven liver tumors,
                  systemically-delivered mRNA-LNP circuits significantly reduced
                  tumor burden. Further, therapeutic circuits provided more
                  potent killing of Ras-mutant cancer cells than the Ras
                  inhibitors Sotorasib and RMC-7977 7,28–30 , and exhibited

                  nascent polypeptide chains along folding pathways towards
                  biologically active states. A hallmark of the co-translational
                  folding (coTF) of many proteins are highly stable folding
                  intermediates that are absent or only transiently populated
                  off the ribosome, yet persist during translation well-beyond
                  complete emergence of the domain from the ribosome exit
                  tunnel. Intermediates are important for folding fidelity;
                  however, their structures have remained elusive. Here, we have
                  structurally characterised two coTF intermediates of an
                  immunoglobulin-like domain by developing comprehensive 19 F
                  NMR analyses using chemical shifts, paramagnetic relaxation
                  enhancement (PRE), and protein engineering. We integrated
                  these experimental data with extensive molecular dynamics (MD)
                  simulations to obtain atomistic structures of the folding
                  intermediates on the ribosome. The resulting intermediate
                  structures are distinguished by native-like folds initiated
                  from either their N-or C-termini, and reveal parallel folding
                  pathways, which are structurally conserved within the protein
                  domain family, in contrast to their in vitro refolding
                  mechanisms. By redirecting proteins to fold along
                  hierarchical, parallel routes, the ribosome may promote
                  efficient folding by avoiding kinetic traps, and regulate
                  nascent chain assembly and targeting by auxiliary factors to
                  maintain cellular proteostasis.}

                  does not guarantee designability--the likelihood that a

                  this gap, we redefine the training objective by steering
                  sequence generation toward high designability. To do this, we

                  significantly improves the in silico design success rate. To
                  further refine sequence generation at a finer, residue-level
                  granularity, we introduce Residue-level Designability
                  Preference Optimization (ResiDPO), which applies residue-level
                  structural rewards and decouples optimization across residues.
                  This enables direct improvement in designability while

                  addition to being more accurate than previous datasets, our
                  database (available online) contains 1,938,936 bacterial TMBB

                  is suggestive of previously hypothesized duplication events.

                  LGLGYRF. However, this β-signal is only characteristic of

                  other C-terminal motifs, and it remains to be determined if
                  these alternative motifs facilitate TMBB insertion or perform

                  systems with reduced computational costs. CG models achieve it
                  by discarding atomic information necessary for downstream
                  structural analysis. Recovering the atomic detail from CG
                  structures, i.e. backmapping, remains a fundamental challenge
                  in multiscale modeling, especially for proteins and complex
                  biomolecular assemblies. Recent machine learning methods have
                  shown promise in reconstructing atomistic details, but most
                  approaches only target simple systems at a small scale. In
                  particular, conventional backmapping pipelines often fail to
                  preserve stereochemistry, induce high-energy configurations,
                  or require extensive minimization. Here we present CGBack, a

                  backmapping both single-chain and multi-chain molecular
                  systems, including densely packed intrinsically disordered

                  accuracy by making several key modifications, 1) Multi-step
                  AF3 sampler is replaced by a few-step ODE sampler,
                  significantly reducing computational overhead for the
                  diffusion module part during inference; 2) In the open-source
                  Protenix framework, a subset of pairformer or diffusion
                  transformer blocks doesn't make contributions to the final
                  structure prediction, presenting opportunities for
                  architectural pruning and lightweight redesign; 3) A model
                  incorporating an ESM module is trained to substitute the
                  conventional MSA module, reducing MSA preprocessing time.
                  Building on these key insights, we present Protenix-Mini, a

                  more efficient architectural design with a two-step Ordinary
                  Differential Equation (ODE) sampling strategy. By eliminating
                  redundant Transformer components and refining the sampling
                  process, Protenix-Mini significantly reduces model complexity
                  with slight accuracy drop. Evaluations on benchmark datasets
                  demonstrate that it achieves high-fidelity predictions, with
                  only a negligible 1 to 5 percent decrease in performance on
                  benchmark datasets compared to its full-scale counterpart.

  abstract     = {Recently, many generative models for de novo protein structure
                  design have emerged. Yet, only few tackle the difficult task
                  of directly generating fully atomistic structures jointly with
                  the underlying amino acid sequence. This is challenging, for
                  instance, because the model must reason over side chains that
                  change in length during generation. We introduce La-Proteina
                  for atomistic protein design based on a novel partially latent
                  protein representation: coarse backbone structure is modeled
                  explicitly, while sequence and atomistic details are captured
                  via per-residue latent variables of fixed dimensionality,
                  thereby effectively side-stepping challenges of explicit
                  side-chain representations. Flow matching in this partially
                  latent space then models the joint distribution over sequences
                  and full-atom structures. La-Proteina achieves
                  state-of-the-art performance on multiple generation
                  benchmarks, including all-atom co-designability, diversity,
                  and structural validity, as confirmed through detailed
                  structural analyses and evaluations. Notably, La-Proteina also
                  surpasses previous models in atomistic motif scaffolding
                  performance, unlocking critical atomistic
                  structure-conditioned protein design tasks. Moreover,
                  La-Proteina is able to generate co-designable proteins of up
                  to 800 residues, a regime where most baselines collapse and
                  fail to produce valid samples, demonstrating La-Proteina's
                  scalability and robustness.},

                  interpretability in many protein prediction problems. To
                  address this issue, we developed AAontology-a two-level
                  classification for 586 amino acid scales (mainly from AAindex)

  abstract     = {A wooden house frame consists of many different lumber pieces,
                  but because of the regularity of these building blocks, the
                  structure can be designed using straightforward geometrical
                  principles. The design of multicomponent protein assemblies,
                  in comparison, has been much more complex, largely owing to
                  the irregular shapes of protein structures1. Here we describe
                  extendable linear, curved and angled protein building blocks,
                  as well as inter-block interactions, that conform to specified
                  geometric standards; assemblies designed using these blocks
                  inherit their extendability and regular interaction surfaces,
                  enabling them to be expanded or contracted by varying the
                  number of modules, and reinforced with secondary struts. Using
                  X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy, we validate
                  nanomaterial designs ranging from simple polygonal and
                  circular oligomers that can be concentrically nested, up to
                  large polyhedral nanocages and unbounded straight 'train
                  track' assemblies with reconfigurable sizes and geometries
                  that can be readily blueprinted. Because of the complexity of
                  protein structures and sequence-structure relationships, it
                  has not previously been possible to build up large protein
                  assemblies by deliberate placement of protein backbones onto a
                  blank three-dimensional canvas; the simplicity and geometric
                  regularity of our design platform now enables construction of

                  biology. Despite this, the process of crystallization remains
                  poorly understood and highly empirical, with crystal contacts,
                  lattice packing arrangements and space group preferences being
                  largely unpredictable. Programming protein crystallization
                  through precisely engineered side-chain-side-chain
                  interactions across protein-protein interfaces is an
                  outstanding challenge. Here we develop a general computational
                  approach for designing three-dimensional protein crystals with
                  prespecified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that
                  hierarchically constrains the overall number of degrees of
                  freedom of the system. We design three pairs of oligomers that
                  can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously
                  self-assemble into >100 µm three-dimensional crystals. The
                  structures of these crystals are nearly identical to the
                  computational design models, closely corresponding in both
                  overall architecture and the specific protein-protein
                  interactions. The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be
                  systematically redesigned while retaining the space group
                  symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are
                  extremely porous and highly stable. Our approach enables the
                  computational design of protein crystals with high accuracy,
                  and the designed protein crystals, which have both structural
                  and assembly information encoded in their primary sequences,

                  of biological phenomena from how cells send and receive
                  signals to how pharmaceutical compounds can be used to treat
                  diseases. Quantitative and predictive free energy calculations
                  require computational models that accurately capture both the
                  varied and intricate electronic interactions between molecules
                  as well as the entropic contributions from motions of these
                  molecules and their aqueous environment. However, accurate
                  quantum-mechanical energies and forces can only be obtained
                  for small atomistic models, not for large biomacromolecules.
                  Here, we demonstrate how to consistently link accurate
                  quantum-mechanical data obtained for substructures to the
                  overall potential energy of biomolecular complexes by machine
                  learning in an integrated algorithm. We do so using a two-fold
                  quantum embedding strategy where the innermost quantum cores
                  are treated at a very high level of accuracy. We demonstrate
                  the viability of this approach for the molecular recognition
                  of a ruthenium-based anticancer drug by its protein target,
                  applying traditional quantum chemical methods. As such methods

                  impact the resulting free energies. Once the requirements are
                  met, our computational pipeline FreeQuantum is able to make
                  efficient use of the quantum computed energies, thereby
                  enabling quantum computing enhanced modeling of biochemical
                  processes. This approach combines the exponential speedups of
                  quantum computers for simulating interacting electrons with

                  unparalleled structural coverage at near-experimental
                  accuracy, positioning it as a valuable resource for
                  data-driven protein design. However, its direct use in
                  training deep models that are sensitive to fine-grained atomic
                  geometry, such as inverse folding, exposes a critical
                  limitation. Comparative analysis of structural feature
                  distributions reveals that AFDB structures exhibit distinct
                  statistical regularities, reflecting a systematic geometric
                  bias that deviates from the conformational diversity found in
                  experimentally determined structures from the Protein Data
                  Bank (PDB). While AFDB structures are cleaner and more
                  idealized, PDB structures capture the intrinsic variability
                  and physical realism essential for generalization in
                  downstream tasks. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a
                  Debiasing Structure AutoEncoder (DeSAE) that learns to
                  reconstruct native-like conformations from intentionally
                  corrupted backbone geometries. By training the model to
                  recover plausible structural states, DeSAE implicitly captures
                  a more robust and natural structural manifold. At inference,
                  applying DeSAE to AFDB structures produces debiased structures
                  that significantly improve inverse folding performance across
                  multiple benchmarks. This work highlights the critical impact
                  of subtle systematic biases in predicted structures and
                  presents a principled framework for debiasing, significantly
                  boosting the performance of structure-based learning tasks

                  function. The active site, however, is densely packed and
                  extremely sensitive to mutations. Therefore, some mutations
                  may only be tolerated in combination with others in a
                  phenomenon known as epistasis. Epistasis reduces the
                  likelihood of obtaining improved functional variants and
                  dramatically slows natural and lab evolutionary processes.
                  Research has shed light on the molecular origins of epistasis
                  and its role in shaping evolutionary trajectories and
                  outcomes. In addition, sequence- and AI-based strategies that
                  infer epistatic relationships from mutational patterns in
                  natural or experimental evolution data have been used to
                  design functional protein variants. In recent years,
                  combinations of such approaches and atomistic design
                  calculations have successfully predicted highly functional
                  combinatorial mutations in active sites. These were used to

                  demonstrating that, while our understanding of epistasis
                  remains incomplete, some of the determinants that are critical
                  for accurate design are now sufficiently understood. We
                  conclude that the space of active-site variants that has been
                  explored by evolution may be expanded dramatically to enhance
                  natural activities or discover new ones. Furthermore, design
                  opens the way to systematically exploring sequence and
                  structure space and mutational impacts on function, deepening

                  a kinetic selection assay, and machine learning to massively
                  perturb the energetics of the nucleation reaction of amyloid-β

                  that constructs complete all-atom protein structures,
                  including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular
                  dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph
                  neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent
                  embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using
                  three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based.
                  A diffusion model trained on these latent representations
                  generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized
                  by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates.

                  the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the
                  sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the

                  distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than

                  practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble
                  generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for
                  structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic

                  sequences that can fold into a desired protein structure, with
                  recent deep learning advances showing strong potential and
                  competitive performance. However, challenges remain, such as
                  predicting elements with high structural uncertainty,
                  including disordered regions. To tackle such low-confidence
                  residue prediction, we propose a mask-prior-guided denoising
                  diffusion (MapDiff) framework that accurately captures both
                  structural information and residue interactions for inverse
                  protein folding. MapDiff is a discrete diffusion probabilistic
                  model that iteratively generates amino acid sequences with
                  reduced noise, conditioned on a given protein backbone. To
                  incorporate structural information and residue interactions,
                  we have developed a graph-based denoising network with a
                  mask-prior pretraining strategy. Moreover, in the generative
                  process, we combine the denoising diffusion implicit model
                  with Monte-Carlo dropout to reduce uncertainty. Evaluation on
                  four challenging sequence design benchmarks shows that MapDiff
                  substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
                  Furthermore, the in silico sequences generated by MapDiff
                  closely resemble the physico-chemical and structural
                  characteristics of native proteins across different protein

                  generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore
                  conformational diversity altogether. We present latent
                  diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework
                  that constructs complete all-atom protein structures,
                  including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular
                  dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph
                  neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent
                  embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using
                  three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based.
                  A diffusion model trained on these latent representations
                  generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized
                  by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates.
                  Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of
                  the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the
                  sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the
                  reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom
                  lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8)
                  and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle
                  distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than
                  0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a
                  practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble
                  generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for
                  structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic
                  targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely

                  and high-end omic technologies has allowed investigation of
                  single cell sets across multiple omic domains and a thorough
                  exploration of cellular function and various functional
                  stages. While most multi-omic studies focused on dual RNA and
                  protein analysis of single cell population, it is crucial to
                  include lipid and metabolite profiling to comprehensively
                  elucidate molecular mechanisms and pathways governing cell
                  function, as well as phenotype at different functional stages.
                  Methods: To address this gap, a cellular lipidomics and
                  transcriptomics phenotyping approach employing simultaneous
                  extraction of lipids, metabolites, and RNA from single cell
                  populations combined with untargeted cellular 4 dimensional
                  (4D)-lipidomics profiling along with RNA sequencing was
                  developed to enable comprehensive multi-omic molecular
                  profiling from the lowest possible number of cells. Reference
                  cell models were utilized to determine the minimum number of
                  cells required for this multi-omics analysis. To demonstrate
                  the feasibility of higher resolution cellular multi-omics in
                  early-stage identification of cellular phenotype changes in
                  pathological and physiological conditions we implemented this
                  approach for phenotyping of macrophages in two different
                  activation stages: MyD88-knockout macrophages as a cellular
                  model for atherosclerosis protection, and wild type
                  macrophages. Results and Discussion: This multi-omic study
                  enabled the determination of the lipid content remodeling in
                  macrophages with anti-inflammatory and atherosclerotic
                  protective function acquired by MyD88-KO, hence expedites the
                  understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind immune cells
                  effector functionality and of possible molecular targets for
                  therapeutic intervention. An enriched functional role of

                  alkaloids, giving them structural similarity to
                  neurotransmitters, thus enabling their modulation of
                  neurotransmitter receptors3. The haem catalase chanoclavine
                  synthase (EasC) catalyses the construction of this ring
                  through complex radical oxidative cyclization4. Unlike
                  canonical catalases, which catalyse H2O2

                  broader class of catalases that catalyse O2-dependent radical
                  reactions4,7. We have elucidated the structure of EasC by
                  cryo-electron microscopy, revealing a nicotinamide adenine
                  dinucleotide phosphate (reduced) (NADPH)-binding pocket and a
                  haem pocket common to all haem catalases, with a unique

                  binds in the NADPH-binding pocket, instead of the previously
                  suspected haem-binding pocket, and two pockets were connected
                  by a slender tunnel. Contrary to the established mechanisms,
                  EasC uses superoxide rather than the more generally used

                  pathologies including inflammation, cell death, and organ
                  failure. Neutralization of histone H3 is a strategy that was
                  shown beneficial in various diseases, such as rheumatoid
                  arthritis, myocardial infarction, and sepsis. It was shown
                  that activated protein C (APC) can cleave histone H3, which
                  reduces histone cytotoxicity. However, due to the
                  anticoagulant properties of APC, the use of APC is not optimal
                  for the treatment of histone-mediated cytotoxicity, in view of
                  its associated bleeding side effects. OBJECTIVES: This study
                  aimed to investigate the detailed molecular interactions
                  between human APC and human histone H3, and subsequently use
                  molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation methods to
                  identify key interacting residues that mediate the interaction
                  between APC and histone H3 and to generate novel optimized APC
                  variants. METHODS: After molecular simulations, the designed
                  APC variants 3D2D-APC (Lys37-39Asp and Lys62-63Asp) and
                  3D2D2A-APC (Lys37-39Asp, Lys62-63Asp, and Arg74-75Ala) were
                  recombinantly expressed and their abilities to function as
                  anticoagulant, to bind histones, and to cleave histones were
                  tested and correlated with their cytoprotective properties.
                  RESULTS: Compared with wild type-APC, both the 3D2D-APC and
                  3D2D2A-APC variants showed a significantly decreased
                  anticoagulant activity, increased binding to histone H3, and
                  similar ability to proteolyze histone H3. CONCLUSIONS: Our
                  data show that it is possible to rationally design APC
                  variants that may be further developed into therapeutic
                  biologicals to treat histone-mediated disease, by proteolytic
                  reduction of histone-associated cytotoxic properties that do
                  not induce an increased bleeding risk.},

  abstract     = {In persons with dyslipidemia, a high residual risk of
                  cardiovascular disease remains despite lipid lowering therapy.
                  Current cardiovascular risk prediction mainly focuses on
                  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels, neglecting
                  other contributing risk factors. Moreover, the efficacy of
                  LDL-c lowering by statins resulting in reduced cardiovascular
                  risk is only partially effective. Secondly, from a
                  metrological viewpoint LDL-c falls short as a reliable
                  measurand. Both direct and calculated LDL-c tests produce
                  inaccurate test results at the low end under aggressive lipid
                  lowering therapy. As LDL-c tests underperform both clinically
                  and metrologically, there is an urging need for molecularly
                  defined biomarkers. Over the years, apolipoproteins have
                  emerged as promising biomarkers in the context of
                  cardiovascular disease as they are the functional workhorses
                  in lipid metabolism. Among these, apolipoprotein B (ApoB),
                  present on all atherogenic lipoprotein particles, has
                  demonstrated to clinically outperform LDL-c. Other
                  apolipoproteins, such as Apo(a) - the characteristic
                  apolipoprotein of the emerging risk factor lipoprotein(a) -,
                  and ApoC-III - an inhibitor of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein
                  clearance -, have attracted attention as well. To support
                  personalized medicine, we need to move to molecularly defined
                  risk markers, like the apolipoproteins. Molecularly defined
                  diagnosis and molecularly targeted therapy require molecularly
                  measured biomarkers. This review provides a summary of the
                  scientific validity and (patho)physiological role of nine
                  serum apolipoproteins, Apo(a), ApoB, ApoC-I, ApoC-II,

  abstract     = {AbstractLearning the design patterns of proteins from
                  sequences across evolution may have promise toward generative
                  protein design. However it is unknown whether language models,
                  trained on sequences of natural proteins, will be capable of
                  more than memorization of existing protein families. Here we
                  show that language models generalize beyond natural proteins
                  to generatede novoproteins. We focus on two protein design
                  tasks: fixed backbone design where the structure is specified,
                  and unconstrained generation where the structure is sampled
                  from the model. Remarkably although the models are trained
                  only on sequences, we find that they are capable of designing
                  structure. A total of 228 generated proteins are evaluated
                  experimentally with high overall success rates (152/228 or
                  67\%) in producing a soluble and monomeric species by size
                  exclusion chromatography. Out of 152 experimentally successful
                  designs, 35 have no significant sequence match to known
                  natural proteins. Of the remaining 117, sequence identity to
                  the nearest sequence match is at median 27\%, below 20\% for 6
                  designs, and as low as 18\% for 3 designs. For fixed backbone
                  design, the language model generates successful designs for
                  each of eight experimentally evaluated artificially created
                  fixed backbone targets. For unconstrained generation, sampled
                  proteins cover diverse topologies and secondary structure
                  compositions, and have high experimental success rate (71/129
                  or 55\%). The designs reflect deep patterns linking sequence
                  and structure, including motifs that occur in related natural
                  structures, and motifs that are not observed in similar
                  structural contexts in known protein families. The results
                  show that language models, though only trained on sequences,
                  learn a deep grammar that enables the design of protein
                  structure, extending beyond natural proteins.},

                  schemas undisturbed, the hybrid proteins are more likely to be
                  folded and functional. Crossovers found by screening libraries
                  of several randomly shuffled proteins for functional hybrids
                  strongly correlate with those predicted by this approach.

                  discovery efforts. However, structural studies of GPCRs remain
                  challenging, particularly for inactive state structures, which
                  often require extensive protein engineering. Here, we present
                  a de novo design strategy termed “click fusion” for generating
                  fusion proteins to facilitate GPCR structural studies. Our
                  method involves the rational design of structurally stable
                  protein domains rigidly linked to GPCRs. The resulting fusion
                  protein enhances the thermostability of the target GPCR and
                  aids in determining GPCR structures via cryo-electron
                  microscopy (cryo-EM). We further demonstrate that the designed
                  fusion protein can be transferred among structurally similar

                  sex steroids from murine serum and reproductive tissues. The
                  assay gave excellent dilutional linearity (r(2)> or =0.98) and
                  reproducibility (CV< or =10\% of replicate samples) in serum
                  and reproductive tissues with sensitive quantitation limits;
                  testosterone (T; 2pg), dihydrotestosterone (DHT; 10pg),
                  5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol (3alphaDiol; 40pg),
                  5alpha-androstane-3beta,17beta-diol (3betaDiol; 40pg),
                  estradiol (E2; 0.5pg) and estrone (E1; 0.3pg). Using 0.1mL
                  sample, T was the only consistently detectable steroid
                  (detection limit 20pg/ml) in both male and female mouse serum.
                  In the testis, T and DHT were quantifiable as were both diols
                  at relatively high levels. Prostatic T levels were low and DHT
                  was determined to be the most abundant androgen in this
                  tissue. Uterine and ovarian levels of E2, E1 and T were
                  measurable, with levels varying according to estrous cycle
                  stage. Hence, we demonstrate that this LC-MS/MS method has the
                  sensitivity, specificity and multi-analyte capability to offer
                  accurate steroid profiling in mouse serum and reproductive
                  tissues.},

                  framework for constraining design simulations to balance
                  different physical characteristics. Each trait is represented
                  by the equilibrium fractional occupancy of the desired state
                  relative to its alternatives, ranging from none to full
                  occupancy, and the different traits are combined using Boolean
                  operators to effect a "fuzzy"-logic language for encoding any

                  on the rates of amino acid substitutions. More recently, with

                  dramatic increase in reliability and scale. With these
                  advances, dozens and even thousands of designed proteins are
                  automatically generated and screened. Nevertheless, the
                  success rate, particularly in design of functional proteins,
                  is low and fundamental goals such as reliable de novo design
                  of efficient enzymes remain beyond reach. Experimental
                  analyses have consistently indicated that a major reason for
                  design failure is inaccuracy and misfolding relative to the
                  design conception. To address this challenge, we describe
                  complementary methods to diagnose and ameliorate suboptimal
                  regions in designed proteins: first, we develop a Rosetta
                  atomistic computational mutation scanning approach to detect
                  energetically suboptimal positions in designs (available on a
                  web server https://pSUFER.weizmann.ac.il); second, we
                  demonstrate that AlphaFold2 ab initio structure prediction
                  flags regions that may misfold in designed enzymes and
                  binders; and third, we focus FuncLib design calculations on
                  suboptimal positions in a previously designed low-efficiency
                  enzyme, improving its catalytic efficiency by 330-fold.
                  Furthermore, applied to a de novo designed protein that
                  exhibited limited stability, the same approach markedly
                  improved stability and expressibility. Thus, foldability
                  analysis and enhancement may dramatically increase the success
                  rate in design of functional proteins.},

                  diversity of disciplinary perspectives brought to bear on the
                  question. Despite significant progress in our understanding of
                  biological systems, psychology, computation, and information
                  theory, no single definition for life has yet achieved
                  universal acceptance. This challenge becomes increasingly
                  urgent as advances in synthetic biology, artificial
                  intelligence, and astrobiology challenge our traditional
                  conceptions of what it means to be alive. We undertook a
                  methodological approach that leverages large language models
                  (LLMs) to analyze a set of definitions of life provided by a
                  curated set of cross-disciplinary experts. We used a novel
                  pairwise correlation analysis to map the definitions into
                  distinct feature vectors, followed by agglomerative
                  clustering, intra-cluster semantic analysis, and t-SNE
                  projection to reveal underlying conceptual archetypes. This
                  methodology revealed a continuous landscape of the themes
                  relating to the definition of life, suggesting that what has
                  historically been approached as a binary taxonomic problem
                  should be instead conceived as differentiated perspectives
                  within a unified conceptual latent space. We offer a new
                  methodological bridge between reductionist and holistic
                  approaches to fundamental questions in science and philosophy,
                  demonstrating how computational semantic analysis can reveal
                  conceptual patterns across disciplinary boundaries, and
                  opening similar pathways for addressing other contested

                  have somehow eluded over a century of work by evolutionary
                  biologists, going so far as to elevate their ideas to the same
                  stature as the fundamental laws of physics. These claims have
                  been made in the apparent absence of any awareness of the
                  theoretical framework of evolutionary biology that has existed
                  for decades. The numerical indices being promoted suffer from
                  numerous conceptual and quantitative problems, to the point of
                  being devoid of meaning, with the authors even failing to
                  recognize the distinction between mutation and selection.
                  Moreover, the promulgators of these new laws base their
                  arguments on the idea that natural selection is in relentless
                  pursuit of increasing organismal complexity, despite the

                  in the opposite direction. Evolutionary biology embraces

                  why the field of evolution should be subject to levels of
                  unsubstantiated speculation that would be unacceptable in any

  abstract     = {Events and festivals are key elements of the tourism product
                  in many destinations (Getz and Page, 2016). The ability of
                  festivals and events to attract visitors to a host region, and
                  to contribute to its economic and social well-being explains
                  the significance afforded to them in many tourism policies and
                  strategies (Mair and Whitford, 2013). This contribution is a
                  strong justification for public funding of events and
                  festivals (Felsenstein and Fleischer, 2003; O’Hagan, 1992).
                  Thus, in conjunction with tourism, they are becoming a
                  realistic policy option for regional development (Moscardo,
                  2007; Robinson et al., 2004). However, the rapid growth of the
                  events/festival industry in the past few decades has not
                  always been matched with the level of research devoted to
                  investigating it. Additionally, the fragmented nature of the
                  research that exists poses challenges for researchers and
                  practitioners trying to identify both the existing knowledge
                  and any research gaps. Nonetheless, the interest of the
                  academic community in event and festival research has
                  increased significantly, particularly in the past decade. This
                  has broadly aligned with the time that the International
                  Journal of Event and Festival Management has been in
                  existence. Here we look back on the general direction of
                  research in our field and provide some potential avenues for
                  future research to strengthen and enrich event and festival
                  research.To date, several reviews have examined the state of
                  research relating to festivals and events. Getz (2010)
                  reviewed the literature on festivals, identifying three major
                  discourses – a classical discourse, concerning the roles,
                  meanings and impacts of festivals in society and culture; an
                  instrumentalist discourse, where festivals are viewed as tools
                  to be used in economic development, particularly in relation
                  to tourism and place marketing; and an event management
                  discourse, which focuses on the production and marketing of
                  festivals and the management of festival organisations (Getz,
                  2010). Getz and Page (2016) also reviewed the event tourism
                  literature. According to Getz (2013), there are five core
                  propositions of event tourism: events can attract visitors who
                  may not otherwise visit the area; events can create a positive
                  destination image and branding; events contribute to place
                  marketing by making destinations more attractive; events
                  animate cities, resorts and parks; and event tourism is a
                  catalyst for other forms of development. A more recent review
                  of trends in event management research was published in 2017,
                  highlighting the themes which appeared to represent the most
                  popular research topics over the period from 1998 until 2013
                  in studies published in leading hospitality and tourism as
                  well as event-focused academic journals (Park and Park, 2017).
                  A total of 698 articles were analysed and results showed that
                  the most popular research topics were marketing, events and
                  destinations and management. Planning and evaluation of events
                  along with the use of technology in events were also well
                  represented in this sample. However, events education and
                  human resources in events appeared to be less well researched
                  (Park and Park, 2017). Other reviews have been completed in
                  the area of festivals, but they have been limited by a focus
                  on papers published in journals associated with one discipline
                  or field of study only. For example, Cudny (2014) took a
                  geographical perspective and Frost (2015) reviewed
                  anthropological studies of festivals, which broadly position
                  festivals as sites of cultural practice and experience.
                  However, neither addressed festival management issues.The
                  literature on events and festivals has been approached from a
                  number of theoretical perspectives. Initially, cultural and
                  social research predominated. However, more recently far more
                  research has taken a business orientation, focusing on themes
                  such as management, marketing and tourism, as noted by Park
                  and Park (2017).The links between events (particularly
                  festivals) and tourism have been a fertile area for research.
                  Increasing tourism is one of the key reasons why local
                  governments support and stage festivals (Mayfield and
                  Crompton, 1995), and according to Anderssen and Getz (2009),
                  many destinations view festivals as attractions and use them
                  as part of their destination marketing strategy. There are
                  clear benefits to hosting festivals, primarily in terms of
                  economic but also social benefits. In relation to economic
                  benefits, increasing visitor numbers, supporting job creation
                  and underpinning economic development appear to be the main
                  positive impacts of festivals; however, the extent of such
                  positive impacts is disputed in relation to whether festivals
                  actually attract visitors (McKercher et al., 2006); whether
                  visitors are even aware of festivals when they make their
                  destination decision (Oh and Lee, 2012); and whether festival
                  visitors, many of whom camp and eat on the festival site, are
                  actually making much economic contribution at all (Saleh and
                  Ryan, 2003). Further, in relation to social benefits such as
                  community cohesion, sense of place, belonging and identity,
                  the literature appears somewhat contrary. While there is
                  plenty of evidence to suggest that these are the objectives of
                  festival organisers, funding bodies and local authorities,
                  there appears to be less evidence of whether festivals are
                  successful in achieving these objectives, and through which
                  mechanisms this may be facilitated. Further, while festivals
                  have unique features and cultural dimensions which are also
                  important factors for attracting tourists, the importance of
                  exercising caution when using tangible or intangible historic
                  and cultural resources for festival activities seems to be
                  less acknowledged. Therefore, while the potential benefits of
                  festivals have been clearly outlined, research appears to be
                  lacking in terms of truly comprehending how best to achieve
                  these desired benefits.There is also a significant body of
                  work that examines events/festivals and marketing, with this
                  topic representing the most widely researched theme identified
                  by Park and Park (2017). Drawing on initial work by Crompton
                  and McKay (1997), who proposed six key motivational dimensions
                  to explain festival attendance, researchers have examined
                  attendance motivations in a multitude of contexts, yet for the
                  most part, few significant differences have been found.
                  Existing reviews have already ascertained that attendance
                  motivations have been thoroughly researched (Getz, 2010); yet,
                  studies continue to be published in this topic. For example,
                  while there have been some minor differences to the original
                  Crompton and McKay (1997) motivation framework, the underlying
                  dimensions appear to be relatively stable over time and across
                  a variety of contexts. Nonetheless, each year more studies
                  appear testing these dimensions in yet more
                  contexts.Similarly, an established body of research has
                  concluded that good quality festivals result in attendee
                  satisfaction, which then leads to increased loyalty in the
                  form of future re-purchase intentions (see for example, Anil,
                  2012; Cole and Illum, 2006; Cole and Chancellor, 2009; Lee et
                  al., 2007; Son and Lee, 2011; Mason and Nassivera, 2013).
                  Nevertheless, despite this literature, studies examining the
                  relationship between satisfaction, quality and loyalty
                  continue to be published. Finally, market segmentation studies
                  occur frequently in the festival literature, yet as most are
                  case study based, they are failing to make generalisable
                  contributions to our knowledge of this area. In summary, it
                  appears that in these areas, researchers have simply been
                  making only small, incremental contributions.Several issues
                  have arisen in relation to festival marketing and consumer
                  behaviour which would present useful opportunities for further
                  study. For example, the decision-making process of festival
                  goers requires more research, as much of this research to date
                  has been undertaken in case study contexts, without further
                  generalisation (e.g. Kruger and Saayman, 2012). Further, there
                  is a noticeable lack of research in areas of marketing that
                  more recently gained greater popularity, including
                  experiential marketing, and very little research on the role
                  of social media and events. Experiential marketing focuses
                  primarily on helping consumers to experience a brand, with the
                  goal of forming a memorable connection and an expected outcome
                  of future purchases and brand loyalty. Festivals offer an
                  unrivalled opportunity for organisations to showcase their
                  brands and build a connection in the mind of the consumer
                  between the festival experience and the brand experience, as
                  noted by Chen et al. (2011), yet this is a relatively
                  unexplored area where future research should be carried
                  out.Social media has also been the focus of surprisingly few
                  festival studies thus far. This is particularly unexpected
                  given the widespread use of various types of social media and
                  its obvious links with marketing. In a case study of music
                  festivals, Hudson and Hudson (2013) carried out some
                  pioneering work to understand how festival organisers are
                  engaging with both social media and their consumers. Their
                  findings suggest that music festival organisers are proactive
                  in using social media. In a subsequent study, Hudson et al.
                  (2015) developed a conceptual model that was subsequently
                  tested with music festival attendees. Study findings provided
                  evidence that social media do indeed have a significant
                  influence on emotions and attachments to festival brands, and
                  that social media-based relationships lead to desired outcomes
                  such as positive word of mouth. Montanari et al. (2013)
                  examine an Italian photography festival, and revealed how
                  using social media and Web 2.0 technology enhanced the way the
                  festival was able to communicate with its audience. Social
                  media is also changing the way potential attendees make their
                  attendance decision. Lee et al. (2012) investigated whether
                  engagement with a festival “event” page on Facebook was linked
                  with actual attendance at the festival. They found some
                  evidence to suggest that the event Facebook page stimulated
                  emotions and a desire to attend the actual festival. Research
                  by Williams et al. (2015) suggests that festivals are both
                  generators and animators of electronic word of mouth, but the
                  authors acknowledge the exploratory nature of their research.
                  Sigala (2018a, b) has advanced our conceptual knowledge of
                  social media as it relates to both festival management and
                  marketing, creating a typology of the way that social media is
                  being used in festival management and organisation. She also
                  drew attention to the use and influence of social media on
                  both attendee experiences and decision making and festival
                  marketing strategies. In view of the omnipresent nature of
                  social media, this is an area where there is a considerable
                  need for further research in the festival context; there is
                  ample room for new studies relating to social media to bring
                  theory development and practical implications.Technology
                  mediated experiences are changing the festivalscape as events
                  and festivals integrate hardware, software, netware and
                  humanware into the attendee experience (Neuhofer et al., 2014;
                  Robertson et al., 2015; Van Winkle et al., 2018). ICT has been
                  used at events and festivals for utilitarian and hedonic
                  purposes yet little is known about the implications for the
                  events, attendees, volunteers and other stakeholders. Thus,
                  research into the integration of ICT into the administration,
                  design, marketing, operations and risk management of events
                  and festivals is essential. An upcoming special issue of IJEFM
                  will focus on these key issues.Three key aspects of strategic
                  festival management have received significant attention from
                  researchers – stakeholder management; festival success factors
                  and conversely, festival failures; and festivals and
                  environmental sustainability. The importance of understanding
                  and managing stakeholders is widely acknowledged (e.g. Reid,
                  2007), and it may very well be that further research will
                  simply underline this. However, in relation to other aspects
                  of management, there are certainly areas where more research
                  is required. For example, whilst knowledge transfer appears to
                  be taking place in successful festivals (Stadler et al.,
                  2014), transfer of knowledge is not well defined, or even
                  explicitly acknowledged. Interestingly, festival failure has
                  apparently been the subject of more research than festival
                  success but further areas for useful contributions remain.
                  These include succession planning and risk management. In
                  addition, differences in strategic management planning and
                  operations between festivals under different types of
                  ownership appear significantly under-researched (Andersson and
                  Getz, 2009; Carlsen and Andersson 2011). Despite a few studies
                  (e.g. Robertson and Yeoman, 2014; Yeoman, 2013), there have
                  also been few attempts to foresee future trends and issues
                  that are likely to affect festivals and their management.Getz
                  and Page (2016) also argue for further research to better
                  understand the role that festivals play in bringing together
                  disparate groups such as visitors and residents. Complex
                  relationships between communal identity and place emerge as
                  people have various sets of connections to multiple notions of
                  “place” and “home”. This is an area where social science
                  research could play an important role, bringing together the
                  business aspects of tourism and festival management with the
                  issues of place, space and people researched by geographers
                  and social scientists.There is also a small but growing body
                  of knowledge on festivals and sustainability; however, this
                  topical area offers considerable potential for future
                  research, and ample room for further theoretical and practical
                  contributions. Research attention may be placed on issues such
                  as the triple bottom line, links between festivals and social
                  sustainability, and even the opportunities for festivals to
                  play an education and behaviour change role in relation to
                  pro-environmental behaviour. For example, Andersson and
                  Lundberg (2013) considered the notion of commensurability and
                  proposed a framework for assessing the overall TBL
                  sustainability of a festival by allocating a monetary value to
                  each component. This is done using market values of emission
                  rights, the shadow costs of environmental resources,
                  contingent valuation analysis of (willingness to pay for)
                  socio-cultural impacts and estimates of direct expenditure and
                  opportunity cost. However, the authors acknowledge that there
                  are aspects of their framework which are subjective, and they
                  note that future research is needed to clarify the
                  generalisability of their framework. Duran et al. (2014) also
                  propose a framework – the Sustainable Festival Management
                  Model – which highlights that stakeholder participation,
                  especially non-governmental organisations, the tourism sector
                  and local people who might be impacted by the festival, is
                  vital for the development of a sustainable festival. Van
                  Niekerk and Coetzee (2011) used the VICE model (visitor,
                  industry community and environment) to assess the
                  sustainability of an arts festival in South Africa and suggest
                  that this framework can help to identify critical issues
                  relating to a festival and its sustainability. However, they
                  also note that research using this model is somewhat limited
                  in the events context and that further research on the
                  efficacy and usefulness of the model is required (Van Niekerk
                  and Coetzee, 2011).There are several implications for future
                  festival/event research resulting from the brief overview
                  provided. These can be classified as opportunities for
                  interdisciplinary research, a reliance on the western
                  perspective and a corresponding lack of different cultural
                  perspectives, an absence of research into the pedagogy of
                  festival/event studies and finally, an array of limitations
                  associated with the current body of knowledge.First, there is
                  a lack of interdisciplinary work that incorporates business
                  and social and/or spatial perspectives. In his review, Getz
                  (2010) highlighted that the classical discourse was
                  under-acknowledged in extant festival studies, and that more
                  connections should be made between festival studies and other
                  disciplines such as sociology and anthropology. Further, Cudny
                  (2014) called for more theoretical research to underpin the
                  development of festival studies in future. Much of the work
                  that has taken a business perspective, perhaps not
                  surprisingly, has focused inwards on the festival – how to
                  market, manage, stage it and provide a good quality service
                  and experience (see Park and Park, 2017). However, very little
                  of the festival research appearing in the business literature
                  has been outwardly focused – considering how festivals may be
                  mechanisms for achieving other aims – social, cultural,
                  political, behavioural, etc. Clearly, in order to survive,
                  festivals have to be successful business products, but in
                  order to achieve other objectives, managers need to be aware
                  of some of the issues that are explored in the social sciences
                  and humanities literature, such as inclusion vs exclusion at
                  festivals, festivals and authenticity/tradition, and festivals
                  as spaces of protest, counterculture and self-expression, to
                  name but a few. Interdisciplinary work, using theories and
                  concepts from beyond business disciplines (e.g. social
                  capital, affect and emotion theories and Florida’s (2002,
                  2003) creative industries framework) would inform festival
                  research, and while the majority of recent work being
                  published on festivals has appeared in journals associated
                  with tourism, events and business more broadly, applying other
                  disciplinary theories and frameworks would bring these to a
                  new audience and thus, help to make a greater
                  contribution.Second, there is a dearth of different cultural
                  perspectives in festival and event research. While already
                  highlighted by Getz (2010), it appears that researchers have
                  not paid much heed to his call for comparative and
                  cross-cultural studies. There is a need to move away from
                  Western paradigms when examining non-Western phenomena. For
                  example, Pine (2002) suggested that the development policy of
                  hotel groups or chains established in China needs to consider
                  the Chinese socio-economic context, thus implying that a
                  research model should be developed specifically for China
                  hotel development. China’s hotel industry is different from
                  that of other countries due to fierce competition, multiform
                  ownership and management systems, and coupled with China’s
                  unique culture society might require a different research
                  approach. Similar considerations would be of value in relation
                  to festivals research in other non-western contexts. In a
                  similar vein, the number of countries with resident
                  populations that are culturally diverse has led to an
                  awareness of the importance of building well-organised,
                  multicultural societies (Chin, 1992; Lee et al., 2012; Parekh,
                  2006). Festivals can play a significant role in this.
                  Multicultural festivals are especially important for minority
                  groups seeking to maintain cultural traditions (Lee et al.,
                  2012). However, despite some initial research in this area,
                  further detailed study of the nature of festivals in a
                  multicultural society would be of tremendous value.Third,
                  there are no pedagogical articles specifically related to
                  festival studies. There is a relatively limited body of
                  knowledge relating to teaching event management. For example
                  Getz (2010) highlights that events students should learn and
                  be able to apply both event specific knowledge (such as
                  understanding the meaning, importance and impacts of festivals
                  and events, and in addition their limited duration and
                  episodic nature) as well as management specific knowledge
                  including marketing, finance and accounting. Additionally,
                  initiatives such as the development of the International Event
                  Management Body of Knowledge seek to define research and
                  understand the parameters of events and the knowledge,
                  understanding and skills required in order to succeed in a
                  contemporary environment (Silvers et al., 2005). Nonetheless,
                  the pedagogy of festival and event studies remains an
                  important, yet significantly under-researched area.Finally,
                  there are a number of limitations relating to the existing
                  body of festival/event literature. Reminiscent of other review
                  papers in the broader tourism and hospitality context, and
                  beyond (e.g. Denizci Guillet and Mohammed, 2015; Kong and
                  Cheung, 2009; Mattila, 2004; Yoo and Weber, 2005), the vast
                  majority of papers relating to festival/event research are
                  empirical rather than conceptual and theoretical in nature. In
                  addition, as has been noted already, much of the research in
                  the field of festivals has taken a case study approach. This
                  has arguably limited the scope and scale of our knowledge of
                  festivals. More sophisticated methods, both qualitative and
                  quantitative, would provide a more nuanced study of particular
                  festivals and places, yet at the same time contribute further
                  to advancing our theoretical and practical knowledge of
                  festivals.Given this, a call for greater theory development
                  and testing within the festival context appears timely. This
                  is in line with Oh et al. (2004, p. 441) who note that “[…]
                  applications are not a wrong effort to make; what is needed is
                  a stronger conceptual rigour and meaningful contribution [to]
                  back to the mainstream theoretical thought through creative
                  application and domain-specific theory development
                  activities.”Judith Mair and Karin Weber},

                  free or ticketed), (2) boundaries in distribution partners and
                  technologies and (3) boundaries in promotional

                  intentionally used by festival organisers to build and
                  delineate festival audiences. Implications are drawn on
                  current understandings of the accessibility of music festival
                  spaces, arguing that festival research should move beyond
                  within-space dynamics to grasp the negotiation of diversity
                  and inclusion at festivals more fully.Originality/valueWhile
                  music festivals are often marketed as celebratory spaces that
                  are “welcoming to everyone”, few studies have investigated
                  diversity and inclusion nor marketing and promotion practices
                  at music festivals. This study shows how festival audiences

                  and automated data analysis for quantification of thiamine in
                  urine in less than a minute, without the need for
                  recalibration. For this we use the Cytolysin A nanopore and
                  equip it with an engineered periplasmic thiamine binding
                  protein (TbpA). To allow fast measurements we tuned the
                  affinity of TbpA for thiamine by redesigning the π-π stacking
                  interactions between the thiazole group of thiamine and TbpA.
                  This substitution resulted furthermore in a marked difference

                  discrimination of thiamine from its two phosphorylated forms

                  scaling single-sequence models and their training data,
                  requiring vast compute resources that limit accessibility.
                  Although models that use multiple sequence alignments (MSA),
                  such as MSA Transformer, offer parameter-efficient
                  alternatives by extracting evolutionary information directly
                  from homologous sequences rather than storing it in
                  parameters, they generally underperform compared to
                  single-sequence-based language due to memory inefficiencies
                  that limit the number of sequences and averaging evolutionary
                  signals across the MSA. We address these challenges with MSA
                  Pairformer, a 111M parameter memory-efficient MSA-based
                  protein language model that extracts evolutionary signals most
                  relevant to a query sequence through bi-directional updates of
                  sequence and pairwise representations. MSA Pairformer achieves
                  state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised contact
                  prediction, outperforming ESM2-15B by 6\% points while using
                  two orders of magnitude fewer parameters. In predicting
                  contacts at protein-protein interfaces, MSA Pairformer
                  substantially outperforms all methods with a 24\% point
                  increase over MSA Transformer. Unlike single-sequence models
                  that deteriorate in variant effect prediction as they scale,
                  MSA Pairformer maintains strong performance in both tasks.
                  Ablation studies reveal triangle operations remove indirect
                  correlations, and unlike MSA Transformer, MSA Pairformer does
                  not hallucinate contacts after removing covariance, enabling
                  reliable screening of interacting sequence pairs. Overall, our
                  work presents an alternative to the current scaling paradigm
                  in protein language modeling, enabling efficient adaptation to
                  rapidly expanding sequence databases and opening new

                  controlling where proteins operate in cells and underpins many
                  fundamental processes, from embryonic patterning to synaptic
                  plasticity. This spatial control is mediated by RNA-binding
                  proteins (RBPs) that interact with localization signals within
                  target mRNAs. However, these signals lack overt sequence or
                  structural patterns, even when targeted by the same protein,
                  raising the question of how specificity is achieved. Here, we
                  investigate this question using the Drosophila RBP Egalitarian
                  (Egl), which couples developmentally important mRNAs to
                  microtubule-based transport via Bicaudal D (BicD) and the
                  dynein motor protein. We present cryo-EM structures of
                  Egl-BicD in complex with six different RNAs. Egl uses multiple
                  non-canonical double-stranded RNA-binding domains to
                  cooperatively form a recognition pocket around a localization
                  signal. Despite substantial variation in length and sequence,
                  each signal adopts a bent stem-loop conformation that,
                  together with base-pair identities at two defined sites,
                  drives Egl binding. We further demonstrate that Egl dimers
                  couple RNA binding to transport initiation through coincident
                  detection of two RNA elements within the same transcript.
                  Collectively, we show that diverse localizing mRNAs are
                  recognized through a combination of shape, positional sequence
                  features, and number of structured RNA elements. This work
                  provides a framework for understanding how other RBPs engage

                  interactions. While crowding has been well-studied in vitro
                  and in cells, the inert sugar polymers used to simulate
                  crowding lack the chemical characteristics of biomolecules.
                  Emerging studies guide the development of more relevant models
                  of crowding in the cell, but little work has been done to
                  discern crowding effects on proteins at the cell surface.
                  Using 19F NMR, we measure how protein stability, folding, and
                  intermolecular interactions are modulated by three
                  glycopolymers abundant at the cellular exterior. Biologically
                  relevant glycopolymers including heparin, hyaluronic acid, and
                  mucin significantly stabilize folding of the N-terminal domain
                  of the Drk-SH3 protein. These interactions are enthalpically
                  stabilizing, emphasizing the importance of chemical
                  interactions for biologically relevant crowders. We further
                  show that these glycopolymers stabilize a homodimer formed by
                  the A34F variant of GB1, demonstrating that biological
                  crowders not only affect isolated proteins, but also influence
                  how proteins interact with one another. Crowding is more
                  complex than simple ideas of volume exclusion suggest, and our
                  work guides a more comprehensive understanding of protein
                  crowding in the context of the glycocalyx, the last frontier

                  representations. However, in vivo and in vitro protein folding
                  and function are largely mediated by amino acid sidechains.
                  Given this biochemical relevance, we ask: what happens when
                  sidechain and sequence information are introduced into a

                  SiBaSe, a novel generative model that simultaneously
                  co-designs sidechains, backbones, and sequence. SiBaSe
                  achieves design performance approaching that of
                  state-of-the-art backbone-only models. However, analysis of
                  design patterns reveals that, despite access to sidechain
                  data, the model behaves similarly to a backbone-based model.
                  This appears to arise from uncertainties in the simultaneous
                  modeling of sequence and sidechains that are inherent to
                  flow-based architectures and offers new insight into
                  architectural limitations and opportunities for improving

                  represents a significant open challenge in structural biology.
                  Increasingly many methods have been reported for perturbing
                  and sampling AlphaFold2 (AF2) [1] to achieve multiple
                  conformational states. However, if multiple methods achieve
                  similar results, that does not in itself invalidate any
                  method, nor does it answer why these methods work.
                  Interpreting why deep learning models give the results they do
                  is a critically important endeavor for future model
                  development and appropriate usage. To help the field continue
                  to try to answer these questions, this work addresses
                  misunderstandings and inaccurate conclusions in refs. [2-6].
                  Deep learning methods development moves quickly, and by no
                  means did we think that the implementation of AF-Cluster in
                  [7] would be the final word on how to sample multiple
                  conformations. However, Porter et al.'s primary critique, that
                  AF-Cluster does not use local evolutionary couplings in its
                  MSA clusters, is incorrect. We report here further analysis
                  that underscores our original finding that local evolutionary
                  couplings do indeed play an important role in AF-Cluster
                  predictions, and refute all false claims made against [7].},

                  effects of treatments on patients, and would therefore benefit
                  immensely from computational models that can reliably simulate
                  patient responses, enabling researchers to generate and test
                  large numbers of therapeutic hypotheses safely and
                  economically before initiating costly clinical trials. Even a
                  more specific model that predicts the functional response of
                  cells to a wide range of perturbations would be tremendously
                  valuable for discovering safe and effective treatments that
                  successfully translate to the clinic. Creating such virtual
                  cells has long been a goal of the computational research
                  community that unfortunately remains unachieved given the
                  daunting complexity and scale of cellular biology.
                  Nevertheless, recent advances in AI, computing power, lab
                  automation, and high-throughput cellular profiling provide new
                  opportunities for reaching this goal. In this perspective, we
                  present a vision for developing and evaluating virtual cells
                  that builds on our experience at Recursion. We argue that in
                  order to be a useful tool to discover novel biology, virtual
                  cells must accurately predict the functional response of a
                  cell to perturbations and explain how the predicted response
                  is a consequence of modifications to key biomolecular
                  interactions. We then introduce key principles for designing
                  therapeutically-relevant virtual cells, describe a
                  lab-in-the-loop approach for generating novel insights with
                  them, and advocate for biologically-grounded benchmarks to
                  guide virtual cell development. Finally, we make the case that
                  our approach to virtual cells provides a useful framework for
                  building other models at higher levels of organization,
                  including virtual patients. We hope that these directions
                  prove useful to the research community in developing virtual
                  models optimized for positive impact on drug discovery

                  designs and analytical characteristics, opening the door for
                  their widespread implementation in clinical laboratories.
                  Clinical endocrinology is closely linked to laboratory
                  medicine because hormone quantification is important for the
                  diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of endocrine disorders.
                  Several interferences in immunoassays have been identified
                  through the years; although some are no longer encountered in
                  daily practice, cross-reaction, heterophile antibodies,
                  biotin, and anti-analyte antibodies still cause problems.
                  Newer interferences are also emerging with the development of
                  new therapies. The interfering substance may be exogenous
                  (e.g., a drug or substance absorbed by the patient) or
                  endogenous (e.g., antibodies produced by the patient), and the
                  bias caused by interference can be positive or negative. The
                  consequences of interference can be deleterious when
                  clinicians consider erroneous results to establish a
                  diagnosis, leading to unnecessary explorations or
                  inappropriate treatments. Clinical laboratories and
                  manufacturers continue to investigate methods for the

  abstract     = {Heteromeric pore-forming proteins often contain recognition
                  patterns or stereospecific selection filters. However, the
                  construction of heteromeric pore-forming proteins for
                  single-molecule sensing is challenging due to the
                  uncontrollability of producing position isomers and
                  difficulties in purification of regio-defined products. To
                  overcome these preparation obstacles, we present an in situ
                  strategy involving single-molecule chemical modification of a
                  heptameric pore-forming protein to build a stereo- and
                  regio-specific heteromeric nanopore (hetero-nanopore) with a
                  subunit stoichiometric ratio of 3:4. The steric hindrance
                  inherent in the homo-nanopore of K238C aerolysin directs the
                  stereo- and regio-selective modification of maleimide
                  derivatives. Our method utilizes real-time ionic current
                  recording to facilitate controlled voltage manipulation for
                  stoichiometric modification and position-based side-isomer
                  removal. Single-molecule experiments and all-atom molecular
                  dynamics simulations revealed that the hetero-nanopore
                  features an asymmetric stereo- and regio-defined residue
                  structure. The hetero-nanopore produced was characterized by
                  mass spectrometry and single-particle cryogenic electron
                  microscopy. In a proof-of-concept single-molecule sensing
                  experiment, the hetero-nanopore exhibited 95\% accuracy for
                  label-free discrimination of four peptide stereoisomers with
                  single-amino-acid structural and chiral differences in the
                  mixtures. The customized hetero-nanopores could advance
                  single-molecule sensing.},

  abstract     = {Cortisol is a biomarker for stress monitoring; however, the
                  biomedical and clinical relevance is still controversial due
                  to the complexity of cortisol secretion mechanisms and their
                  circadian cycles as well as environmental factors that affect
                  physiological cortisol level, which include individual mood
                  and dietary intake. To further investigate this multifaceted
                  relationship, a human pilot study examined cortisol
                  concentration in sweat and saliva samples collected from 48
                  college-aged participants during aerobic exercise sessions
                  along with mental distress and nutrition surveys.
                  Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays determined highly
                  significant differences between apocrine-dominant sweat (AP),
                  saliva before exercise (SBE), and saliva after exercise (SAE)
                  cortisol concentration (AP-SBE: p = 0.0017, AP-SAE: p =
                  0.0102). A significantly greater AP cortisol concentration was
                  detected in males compared to females (p = 0.0559), and
                  significant SAE cortisol concentration differences were also
                  recorded between recreational athletes and non-athletes (p =
                  0.044). However, Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10)
                  scores, an examination administered to deduce overall
                  wellness, provided no significant differences between males
                  and females or athletes and non-athletes in distress levels,
                  which statistically signifies a direct relationship to
                  cortisol was not present. For further analysis, dietary intake
                  from all participants was considered to investigate whether a
                  multiplexed association was prevalent between nutrition, mood,
                  and cortisol release. Significant positive correlations
                  between AP cortisol, SAE cortisol, K10 scores, and fat intake
                  among female participants and athletes were discovered. The
                  various machine learning algorithms utilized the extensive
                  connections between dietary intake, overall well-being, sex
                  factors, athletic activity, and cortisol concentrations in
                  various biofluids to predict K10 scores. Indeed, the
                  understanding of physiochemical stress response and the
                  associations between studied factors can advance algorithm
                  developments for cortisol biosensing systems to mitigate
                  stress-based illnesses and improve an individual's quality of
                  life.},

  abstract     = {Protein structures are often conserved across widely divergent
                  sequences, suggesting high mutational robustness. However, how
                  such robustness emerges through evolution, and how it relates
                  to the underlying sequence-structure map, remains poorly
                  understood. In contrast, the mutational profiles (distribution
                  of structures upon point mutation) of RNA secondary structures
                  are well characterised, exhibiting both high mutational
                  robustness and high evolvability through mutational access to
                  diverse folds. The recent revolution in protein structure
                  prediction now enables analagous large-scale analyses for
                  proteins. Here, we use the structure prediction algorithm
                  ESMFold to systematically investigate the mutational profiles
                  of natural, random, and de novo proteins. Unlike RNA, where
                  functional and random sequences share similar mutational
                  profiles, natural proteins are substantially more robust than
                  random amino acid sequences, suggesting an evolutionary drive
                  toward robustness. They also exhibit limited structural
                  variation among close sequence neighbours, potentially
                  constraining access to new folds. Interestingly, many de novo
                  proteins do resemble random sequences in their mutational
                  profiles, with low robustness relative to established
                  proteins. These findings reveal how gene duplication and de
                  novo gene birth follow distinct evolutionary trajectories
                  toward functional proteins and highlight a potential role for
                  large-effect mutations in the emergence of structural
                  complexity.},

                  4-residue beta turns which represent 63\% of the residues in
                  loops. The commonly used classification of beta turns (Type I,
                  I', II, II', VIa1, VIa2, VIb, and VIII) was developed in the
                  1970s and 1980s from analysis of a small number of proteins of
                  average resolution, and represents only two thirds of beta
                  turns observed in proteins (with a generic class Type IV
                  representing the rest). We present a new clustering of
                  beta-turn conformations from a set of 13,030 turns from 1074
                  ultra-high resolution protein structures (≤1.2 Å). Our
                  clustering is derived from applying the DBSCAN and k-medoids
                  algorithms to this data set with a metric commonly used in
                  directional statistics applied to the set of dihedral angles
                  from the second and third residues of each turn. We define 18
                  turn types compared to the 8 classical turn types in common
                  use. We propose a new 2-letter nomenclature for all 18
                  beta-turn types using Ramachandran region names for the two
                  central residues (e.g., 'A' and 'D' for alpha regions on the
                  left side of the Ramachandran map and 'a' and 'd' for
                  equivalent regions on the right-hand side; classical Type I
                  turns are 'AD' turns and Type I' turns are 'ad'). We identify
                  11 new types of beta turn, 5 of which are sub-types of
                  classical beta-turn types. Up-to-date statistics, probability
                  densities of conformations, and sequence profiles of beta
                  turns in loops were collected and analyzed. A library of turn
                  types, BetaTurnLib18, and cross-platform software,
                  BetaTurnTool18, which identifies turns in an input protein

                  Given the ubiquitous nature of beta turns, this comprehensive
                  study updates understanding of beta turns and should also
                  provide useful tools for protein structure determination,
                  refinement, and prediction programs.},

                  newopportunities for probing novel interactions and

                  Here, we present RareFold, a deep learning model capable

                  the 20 canonical amino acids andan additional 29 NCAAs. By

                  learnsresidue-specific atomic interaction patterns, enabling
                  precise modelling of chemically diversesequences. This
